Adding to the difficulty of this process is the lack of good pre-stack common image gathers (CIGs) to extract reliable gather curvature. To overcome this, a common practice is to produce reverse time migration (RTM) angle gathers and perform a tomographic velocity update on them. However, there are two drawbacks associated with standard common-shot RTM angle gathers: (1) subsalt events on angle gathers are usually present for a narrow range of incident angles (i.e., <30\u00b0), and (2) in the presence of migration velocity error, residual curvatures of subsalt events are often degraded due to interference caused by wavefronts propagating from different surface offsets.

In this study we investigate discriminant source and rupture characteristics to distinguish between the two event types and also between reservoir fracture types. To achieve this goal we estimate source and failure properties of \u2212M3 to M1 seismic events recorded during a hydraulic fracturing stimulation of a shale reservoir in Horn River Basin, Canada, for which the >M0 events are associated with slip on a pre-existing fault underneath the reservoir. Comparison between static and dynamic source parameters suggests distinct signatures of the two event types associated to two distinct failure processes. Positive magnitude events occurring beneath the reservoir have slightly higher static and dynamic stress drops, higher apparent stress and energy release, and rupture faster than shallower reservoir events. These differences reflect fracturing of harder rocks at higher confining stresses for the deep events, but also a possible release of a larger quantity of strain energy stored within the fault zone. The lower stress and energy release and slower rupturing fractures observed in the reservoir fractures, as well as overshoot type failure (slip weakening failure) indicates fluid lubrication by pore pressure increase and frictional resistance reduction. Some trends are also observed when looking only at reservoir fractures, where variations in average rupture velocities correlate with variations in formation depth and fault azimuth reflecting a dominance of the local stress field over other factors. Average rupture velocities also correlates with elapsed time showing an observable imprint of the changed local conditions during treatment over the regional conditions. Identification of more spatial and temporal families of events with similar rupture behaviors and source characteristics can be used as a proxy for specific fracture network development and hydrocarbon production and included in geo-mechanical models and fracture treatment designs. Reservoir and fault related induced events release less stress and radiates less energy than natural occurring tectonic earthquakes of comparable size at similar depths indicating a potential fluid influence in these failures. Considering the ongoing debate regarding the cause-effect relationship between fluid injection programs and nearby deeper earthquakes this study suggests that source parameters can be used as a discriminant factor between the two types of earthquakes."], "authors": ["Gisela Viegas*", "Adam Baig", "Eric von Lunen"], "keywords": ["induced seismicity", "microseismic", "monitoring"], "institution": ["Ted Urbancic", "ESG Solutions", "CNOOC-Nexen"]},

For those conducting seismic exploration, it is important to (1) be aware of agency expectations for environmental protection and required monitoring associated with that equipment use, (2) provide sufficient activity details to inform design and modeling that will result in agency acceptance. For industry applicants, it is imperative to be prepared for the time and level of due diligence and background work required to process and ultimately obtain permits and meet regulation and guideline standards. It is paramount to develop reasonable expectations for what the combined permitting, mitigation, and monitoring will entail in terms of document preparation and agency and public review time.

Steering a course towards improving listening conditions for marine life in U.S. waters "], "abstract": ["Increasing human activity, along more of the earth's coastlines and extending farther offshore in deep ocean environments, is leading to rising levels of underwater noise throughout the world's aquatic places. Rising noise levels are impacting the animals and ecosystems that inhabit these places in complex ways, including through acute, chronic, and cumulative effects. In the U.S., the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is the federal agency that holds the most responsibility for protecting aquatic animals and their habitats, through a variety of legal mandates. NOAA's approach towards further understanding and managing underwater noise must be multi-faceted. Numerous studies illustrate specific adverse physical and behavioral effects that exposure to certain sound types and levels can have on different species. Additionally, sound is a fundamental component of the physical and biological habitat that many aquatic animals and ecosystems have evolved to rely on over millions of years. In just the last \u223c100 years human activities have caused large increases in noise and changes in soundscapes (i.e. the sounds heard in a particular location, considered as a whole). These changes can lead to reduced ability to detect and interpret environmental cues that animals use to select mates, find food, maintain group structure and relationships, avoid predators, navigate, and perform other critical life functions. Therefore, NOAA's management goals and actions must aim to conserve the quality of acoustic habitat in addition to minimize more direct adverse physical and behavioral impacts to specific species. To support these objectives, NOAA is investing risk assessment tools that integrate information regarding the impacts of noise on high priority acoustically sensitive and active marine animals and their habitats to support agency science and management decision making."], "authors": ["Leila Hatch*", "Jolie Harrison", "Jason Gedamke", "Sofie Van Parijs", "Jessica Redfern"], "keywords": ["environmental", "acoustic"], "institution": ["Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary, NOAA National Ocean Service", "Office of Protected Resource, NOAA Fisheries", "Office of Science and Technology, NOAA Fisheries", "Northeast Fisheries Science Center, NOAA Fisheries", "Southeast Fisheries Science Center, NOAA Fisheries"]},

The effectiveness of the stimulation program can be assessed by incorporating monitoring programs that include instrumentation to detect seismic events over a broad range of magnitudes from the smallest detectable events with magnitudes below zero (microseismic) to larger events with magnitudes above zero (induced seismic), typically related to larger pre-existing fractures or faults. Stimulating these larger structures could lead to loss of fluid from the reservoir and affect estimates of stimulated volume. In this study, we examine data recorded using a typical downhole microseismic wireline supplemented with a near surface array designed to record induced seismic events. In this study, two horizons were stimulated. The intent of the program was to stimulate both zones by stimulating wells in the lower horizon by increasing pressure rates both early and late into the injection program in the upper horizon. About 4500 microseismic events and 28 induced seismic events were observed. These larger events represent approximately 83% of the total seismic energy released during the stimulation, which, if only using standard recording, would have been mis-interpreted as microseismic events and thereby would not have contributed to the overall energy dissipation levels. The larger events were associated with fractures with lengths varying from about 40 m to over 110 m, whereas the microseismic fracture lengths varied from \u223c5 m up to \u223c 35m. The microseismic and induced seismic events could be used to identify growth from the upper to lower horizon at different pressure rates.

When combined with an energy minimization adaptive subtraction, the ISS internal multiple attenuation algorithm can effectively remove internal multiples when the primaries and internal multiples are separated, and not overlapping or proximal. One of issues that the adaptive subtraction is addressing is the difference between the amplitude of the internal multiple and the approximate amplitude of the attenuation algorithm prediction. However, under certain circumstances, both offshore and onshore, internal multiples are often proximal to or interfering with primaries and the criteria of adaptive subtraction may fail, since the energy can increase when e.g., a multiple is removed from an interfering primary.

The final image is generated on a grid which is denser than that of the original time-shift images.

To fully recover the frequency bandwidth of seismic data, the anelastic nature of the earth needs to be taken into account. In addition, in the presence of gas anomalies, attenuation of seismic waves will cause further degradation in the resolution of migrated images. By quantifying the attenuation of seismic energy using quality factor Q, we can model the intrinsic absorptive nature of the earth as background Q and the localized absorptive bodies, e.g. gas pockets, as anomalous Q. Using the frequency information and the amplitude information of the data to estimate the background Q (FS-QTomo) and anomalous Q (A-QTomo), respectively, the attenuation effects of the earth can be compensated by the application of Q-PSDM in the presence of gas with the resultant combined Q model. The accuracy of these processes is further enhanced by broadband processing with deghosting in terms of better estimation of the centroid frequency for FS-QTomo and deeper penetration of low frequency signal through the gas bodies for A-QTomo. Thus, the interplay of deghosting and Q tomography provides a full broadband processing workflow for restoring the distortion of amplitude, frequency and phase caused by the combined effects of the earth's anelasticity and gas pockets.

The method is built with high-performance computing (HPC) implementation in mind. It implies a high level of parallelism and greatly reduced communication requirements compared to the traditional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods. We split the reference fine grid model into multiple subdomains (coarse cells). Compared to high-order and spectral methods, these cells can be arbitrarily chosen and are fully model-independent. The interaction of coarse cells with their neighbors is determined by a Neumann-to-Dirichlet (NtD) map. We construct a low-dimensional spectrally accurate approximant of the NtD map for each cell using reduced order modeling (ROM) techniques and then sparsify the approximant via transformation to Stieltjes continued fraction (s-fraction). These steps constitute the off-line part of the approach, which is embarassingly parallel. It is performed just once for the entire time-domain simulation for all sources. Similar to multi-scale finite volume methods, to construct the discretization of the full spatial operator, the coarse cells are conjugated via continuity conditions. In the on-line part of the approach, the discretized operator is employed in a time-stepping scheme. Thanks to low-dimensionality and to s-fraction transformation of the coarse cells ROMs, the communication costs in the on-line part are significantly reduced. Further performance improvement has been achieved by increasing the size of the time step. Indeed, properly chosen ROMs enables relaxing the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition. It potentially allows the CFL time step to approach the Nyquist limit, which is typically unattainable with traditional schemes that have the CFL time step much smaller than the Nyquist sampling rate.

Fortunately, the recent development of the non-periodic homogenization technique now enables to overcome this problem by computing smooth equivalent models for which a coarse mesh is sufficient to get an accurate wavefield.

These data were then stacked and compared to the images from the acquired VSP.", "At first look, the finite difference model VSP image area was much larger than the image area of the acquired VSP. One problem was that the RTM produced a much more extensive image both above and below the receivers, a function of the algorithm being able to handle both up-going and down-going energy. The WEM, however, could handle only up-going energy, and produced an image closer in appearance to the VSP processed image. Although the acquired VSP was processed with a reverse time migration, the down-going energy contribution was much less robust than that of the modeled data; this could be due to the velocity model errors in the real world case. Differences between the acquired VSP and the modeled WEM may also be due to velocity model errors in the actual VSP processing. With both migration types, it became apparent that the modeled image areas would likely be interpreted as being significantly more extensive than the actual realized image. However, through detailed inspection, it was possible to determine which areas of the modeled image needed to be discounted. This ultimately resulted in a predicted image that was very similar to the actual VSP image. These learnings were subsequently applied to the modeling of a planned VSP acquisition in a different well, and impacted both the source pattern design and the expected image."], "authors": ["Francis Rollins*", "J.R.

The shaping regularized inversion that treats the spectral division as a regularized least-squares inversion problem can help solve the spectral-nulls problem and make the spectral division stable. In the case of very noisy seismic data, the time-frequency maps can not be optimally obtained and thus the Q estimation performance will be strongly affected even with regularized inversion.

The small platelets of the clay framework have a large surface area and high reactivity with the saturating fluid. A change in fluid saturation affects the elastic moduli and mechanical strength of the clay framework. Rock physical models of clay borne rocks attempt to account for the fluid sensitivity and, if possible, relate changes in elastic moduli to mechanical strength predicting the stability of shales for instance. Rock physical models proposed so far postulates a continuous matrix medium perturbed by a complex pore-structure. The mineralogy of the clay defines the background medium and the pore-space causes the observable moduli of a specific sample. We argue that a clay framework is closer to a granular assembly of individual grains than a continuous solid frame. As such, the interactions between fluid and solid clay can affect the solid structure itself. Therefore, any background medium assumed comes to depend on both the solid mineralogy and the saturating fluid. We demonstrate the sensitivity of the solid frame to the saturating fluid in compacted clay powders. We normalize elastic moduli measured in compacted clay powders to a load-bearing solid cross-section using the iso-frame model. Comparing the moduli of the solid framework in the dry and brine-saturated states shows that brine saturation does affect the solid structure.

The initialization of these models requires knowledge of the pre-existing fractures and geological properties of the media. Orientations of different fracture sets, their intensities and spacing together with a characterization of their size scales (power law) critically impacts geomechanical predictions of both the stimulations in terms of proppant and fluid placement, but also the decline of reservoir productivity. Insight can be gained on the properties of the fracture network through analysis of the microseismic data generated during the stimulation. The frequency response of the waveforms depends on the size of the rupture and necessitates wide band recording in order to provide constraints at a variety of scales. Supplementing low frequency sensors with traditional monitoring high frequency sensors extends the resolvable range to larger scale lengths of fractures. For all these scales, with a sufficient sampling of azimuths around the stimulation, the mechanisms and associated fracture planes and stress/strain conditions can be reconstructed though seismic moment tensor inversion (SMTI) of the recorded waveforms. At smaller scale lengths, signal to noise ratios can be high, and events may not be observed at high enough quality to permit SMTI. To extend the characterization of these fractures to smaller scales, we use a stochastic optimization algorithm designed to search for optimally placed fractures in the reservoir that intersect with the event locations while constraining their orientations to be from the same distribution observed at the larger (SMTI resolvable) length scales. Effectively, this technique allows for the extension of the power law governing the fracture distribution to smaller scales by invoking observed trends in self-similar behavior.

Time reversal is a powerful tool to image directly both microseismic location and mechanism. This technique assumes seismic velocities in the medium and propagates time reversed observations of ground motion at each receiver location. Assuming an accurate velocity model and adequate array aperture, the waves will focus at the source location. Because we do not know the location and the origin time a priori, we need to scan the entire 4D image (3D in space and 1D in time) to find focusing, which makes reverse time migration (RTM) computationally demanding. We propose a new approach to reverse-time imaging that reduces the scanning dimensions from 4D to 3D (no time) and increases the spatial resolution of the source image. We first individually extrapolate wavefields at each receiver, and then crosscorrelate these wavefields (product in the frequency domain: Geometric-mean RTM, GmRTM). This crosscorrelation creates another imaging condition, and the focusing of the seismic wavefields occurs at the zero time lag of the correlation. Through this approach, we can reduce the dimensions of scanning, and hence the computational requirements, from 4D to 3D. The crosscorrelation effectively suppresses the side lobes and yields a high-resolution image. Also, GmRTM is robust for random noise because the crosscorrelation enhances the coherent signals. An added benefit is that, in contrast to conventional one-way RTM, GmRTM has potential to be used to retrieve velocity information by using time and/or space lags of crosscorrelation similar to what is done in active-source imaging."], "authors": ["Nori Nakata*", "Gregory C.

In conventional surface-consistent scaling methods, the scalars are obtained by decomposing the RMS amplitudes of prestack traces that are always contaminated to some extent by noise. The RMS amplitudes are a measure of the total energy on a trace (signal + noise) rather than just signal. Consequently, if noise increases in one area of a survey, the signal in that area is not scaled up enough (the noise biases the scalars). Despite attempts to remove the effects of noise on the derived scalars with various noise attenuation methods, we have observed that data often are poorly scaled at the end of a typical AVO-compliant run stream. As a solution to this problem, Cary and Nagarajappa (2013) proposed an unbiased scaling approach in which the shot and receiver consistent signal estimates were obtained from the RMS amplitudes of the shot and receiver stacks. A restriction of this method is that the data in the analysis window must be nearly flat in order to stack in the shot or receiver domain and obtain accurate scalar estimates. When the data is not flat, then it first needs to be flattened, which can be difficult when geology is complicated. In this paper, we propose an unbiased scaling method that avoids the use of shot and receiver stacks. The proposed method computes the prestack amplitudes from the zero-lag value of the crosscorrelations between each prestack trace and its CDP stack trace. Such a crosscorrelation can provide unbiased prestack amplitudes. In addition, the prestack amplitudes are not dependent on the time variations in the structure.

Because kinematic variables (velocity) are updated, the possibility of cycle-skipping and consequent trapping at local minimizers exists for Born waveform inversion, just as it does for full waveform inversion. Extended Born waveform inversion allows reflectivity to depend on additional parameters, potentially minimizing the likelihood of cycle skipping by permitting data fit throughout the inversion process. Extended or not, the Born waveform inversion objective function is quadratic in the reflectivity, so that a nested optimization approach is available: minimize over reflectivity in an inner stage, then minimize the background-dependent result in a second, outer stage. This paper uses a 2D acoustic modeling, reflectivity permitted to depend on shot coordinates (shot record extension), a differential semblance penalty to control this dependence, and the variable projection variant of nested optimization.

Finite element simulations of this experiment for a horizontal well intersecting a small set of vertical fractures indicate that the fractures manifest electrically in (at least) two ways: a local perturbation in the electric potential proximal the fracture set, with limited far\u2013field expression; and, an overall reduction in the electric potential along the entire length of borehole casing due to enhanced current flow through the fractures into the surrounding formation.

What has not been studied as thoroughly is the response of a loop buried within a conductive medium, as might be the case in the marine environment or when transient electromagnetic prospecting systems are placed in mine tunnels or horizontal boreholes. In this abstract we examine the transient electromagnetic response of a wire loop buried within a conductive halfspace. Expressions are derived for the azimuthal electric field and corresponding vertical and radial magnetic fields. Results show that when the loop is far from the earth-air interface, a single smoke ring system diffuses radially outwards from the loop, as opposed to two loops travelling up and down in the vertical directions (as we previously expected). As the loop burial depth decreases, the smoke ring system diffuses radially at early times, but gradually the complex image of the loop in the air produces a system of secondary azimuthal electric fields which, when combined with the primary field, add a vertical direction to the field diffusion. At late times, the field behaviour reduces to the well-known surface case and the maximum current system diffuses downward at a constant angle of 26 degrees with respect to the plane of the loop.

It is shown with a real data case from the North Sea that a 1000 m separation between the data points results in a poorly resolved overburden where the estimated resistivity structure is clearly not geologically consistent. This also affects the deeper structure where the resolution of the image of the reservoir is degraded. The inversion performance in terms of resolution and covariance is improved significantly when using all data in the Towed Streamer EM data set. A decrease of the spatial data point separation to 250 m makes the resulting overburden resistivity consistent and geologically sound when comparing with available geological information in the area of the survey.

As a rule of thumb, this assumption is taken to be valid when the fracture spacing is less than \u03bb/10. In fracture characterization using AVOAZ, spatial variation of the fracture properties, such as fracture orientation and spacing, are estimated from the anisotropic parameters (e.g. Thomsen's parameters) that are inverted from amplitude variation with offset (AVO) or amplitude variation with azimuth (AVAZ) analysis. Under the effective medium assumption, diffractions from individual fractures are destructively cancelled and only specular reflections from boundaries of a fractured layer can be observed in seismic data. The effective medium theory has been widely used in fracture characterization and its applicability has been validated through many field applications.

A schedule of activation times is referred to as a Popcorn pattern. The resulting time-extended array response is called a Popcorn signature. While the sound pressure levels (SPL) will be reduced, reducing the risk of potential environmental impact, the effect of distributing the activation times of the individual airguns allows a number of other benefits.", "Figure 1: A conventional airgun signature, shown in red, is compared to a Popcorn signature, shown in blue.", "One of the benefits of the Popcorn method is that the coding of the patterns allows improvement in simultaneous source separation.

The use of sources with different codes adds a criterion that will improve the separation. This improved separation allows denser source sampling, which in turn provides better seismic images at little to no cost.", "The pattern of the individual airgun activation times is designed to satisfy the requirements for reconstructing the desired output signal.

The deblending results of synthetic and field data demonstrate obviously that the proposed periodically variational dithering code can obtain a better performance than random dithering code."], "authors": ["Shaohuan Zu", "Hui Zhou", "Ying Liu", "Shan Qu", "Yangkang Chen"], "keywords": ["acquisition", "survey design", "separation"], "institution": ["China University of Petroleum (Beijing)", "The University of Texas at Austin"]},

Instead of collecting data to a central place for post-processing, the distributed seismic data processing and computing are performed in-situ, delivering an evolving 3D image in real-time for visualization. As a paradigm-shifting approach, the RISI system is plug-nplay, scalable, self-adaptive and fault-tolerant. We have created multiple in-situ distributed seismic imaging algorithms including tomography and migration, and validated them using synthetic and field seismic data sets. This paper presents a case study of travel-time seismic tomography.

We compute realistic signal and noise wavefields separately and then combine them in various ways to form 3D surveys with variable S/N. We use two types of noise wavefields: source generated and ambient. We measure the S/N level for source-generated noise (SGN) inside the direct-arrival noise cone so that it represents the relative level of signal to scattered noise, and we use S/N levels of 0 dB and -35 dB so that we have both easy and difficult noise problems. We set the level of ambient noise so that the amplitude of the near-offset, direct-arrival, ground-roll is roughly equal to that for the 3D seismic survey sources. We use grid geometries, and we compare a source grid with 25 meter spacing paired with receiver grids having 25, 50, 100, and 200 meter spacings to the reciprocal cases for their relative performance in coherent noise suppression. In the process, we achieve fold levels of 400, 1600, 6400, and 25,600. When the S/N for SGN is high (i.e. the coherent noise is mostly direct-arrival and the scattered noise is no stronger than the signal), either dense sources and sparse receivers or sparse sources and dense receivers yield high quality images. However, as the S/N due to SGN decreases, dense receiver grids become favored. When ambient noise is included, the balance is further shifted in favor of dense receivers. Furthermore, adequate coherent noise suppression for very low S/N requires an increase in the density of the sparser of the two grids."], "authors": ["Carl Regone*", "Michael Fry", "John Etgen"], "keywords": ["land", "acquisition", "3D", "noise", "modeling"], "institution": ["BP"]},

Sources and receivers have also evolved substantially through this time period; but are the advances in acquisition equipment the main reason for the step change in data quality that we see? We believe that evolution in acquisition geometries and resulting increases in trace density have had a much bigger effect. We have seen step changes in data quality as we move from 2D to 3D, then denser and denser wide azimuth geometries which have recently been augmented with simultaneous source acquisition.
