       " {u'abstract': [u'The success of imaging vertical seismic profile (VSP) data critically depends upon obtaining and using an accurate subsurface velocity model. First-arrival-time tomography can be used to derive velocities above the receivers. Reflection time tomography can be used to derive velocities below the receivers, but it requires reflection time picking and association with appropriate horizons. We described an alternative, faster way to perform velocity analysis by assessing the residual moveout after migrating walk-away VSP data. We have derived residual moveout equations for migrated common receiver gathers assuming a constant velocity model with a single horizontal reflector. The observed residual moveout in common image gathers in the receiver domain will be aligned and flat if the migration velocity is correct. If the residual moveout is not flat, by digitizing the extreme point on the unstacked, migrated traces in each common receiver gather, we could invert for the velocity of the target layer using our new residual moveout equations. We then extended this method to handle depth and laterally varying layer geometries using an iterative root-mean-square velocity scheme and a layer-stripping strategy. We combined the power of a prestack VSP depth migration using complicated velocity structures with straightforward velocity updating equations. For a range of synthetic cases and geometries, the estimated velocities were within 3% of the actual value.'],\n",

In the following we discuss the mathematical and physical approaches behind the use of the different terms. The basic theory of EM wave propagation is reviewed. From a frequency-domain description we show that all of the well-known mathematical tools of wave theory, including an asymptotic ray-series description, can be applied for both nondispersive waves in nonconductive materials and low-frequency waves in conductive materials. We consider the EM field from an electric dipole source and show that a common frequency-domain description yields both the undistorted pulses in nonconductive materials and the strongly distorted pulses in conductive materials. We also show that the diffusion-equation approximation of low-frequency EM fields in conductive materials gives the correct mathematical description, and this equation has wave solutions. Having considered both a wave-picture approach and a diffusion approach to the problem, we discuss the possible confusion that the use of these terms might lead to.'],\n",

We compare and combine two methods for estimating azimuthal orientation by least-squares fitting over a large number of shots. Combining the two methods can be done in an automated manner, which provides more accurate estimates of the geophone orientations than previous methods.

       " {u'abstract': [u'We develop a waveform-tomography method for estimating the velocity distribution that minimizes the waveform misfit between the predicted and observed early arrivals in space-time seismograms. By fitting the waveforms of early arrivals, early arrival waveform tomography (EWT) naturally takes into account more general wave-propagation effects compared to the high-frequency method of traveltime tomography, meaning that EWT can estimate a wider range of slowness wavenumbers. Another benefit of EWT is more reliable convergence compared to full-waveform tomography, because an early-arrival misfit function contains fewer local minima. Synthetic test results verify that the waveform tomogram is much more accurate than the traveltime tomogram and that this algorithm has good convergence properties. For marine data from the Gulf of Mexico, the statics problem caused by shallow, gassy muds was attacked by using EWT to obtain a more accurate velocity model. Using the waveform tomogram to correct for statics, the stacked section was significantly improved compared to using the normal move-out (NMO) velocity, and moderately improved compared to using the traveltime tomogram. Inverting high-resolution land data from Mapleton, Utah, showed an EWT velocity tomogram that was more consistent with the ground truth (trench log) than the traveltime tomogram. Our results suggest that EWT can provide supplemental, shorter-wavelength information compared to the traveltime tomogram for both shallow and moderately deep seismic data.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'Heterogeneous finite-difference (FD) modeling assumes that the boundary conditions of the elastic wavefield between material discontinuities are implicitly fulfilled by the distribution of the elastic parameters on the numerical grid. It is widely applied to weak elastic contrasts between geologic formations inside the earth. We test the accuracy at the free surface of the earth. The accuracy for modeling Rayleigh waves using the conventional standard staggered-grid (SSG) and the rotated staggered grid (RSG) is investigated. The accuracy tests reveal that one cannot rely on conventional numerical dispersion discretization criteria. A higher sampling is necessary to obtain acceptable accuracy. In the case of planar free surfaces aligned with the grid, 15 to 30 grid points per minimum wavelength of the Rayleigh wave are required. The widely used explicit boundary condition, the so-called image method, produces similar accuracy and requires approximately half the sampling of the wavefield compared to heterogeneous free-surface modeling. For a free-surface not aligned with the grid (surface topography), the error increases significantly and varies with the dip angle of the interface. For an irregular interface, the RSG scheme is more accurate than the SSG scheme. The RSG scheme, however, requires 60 grid points per minimum wavelength to achieve good accuracy for all dip angles. The high computation requirements for 3D simulations on such fine grids limit the application of heterogenous modeling in the presence of complex surface topography.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'The shot-profile migration approach of wave-equation migration generates subsurface images using the interferometric principle of crosscorrelating two passive wavefields. These wavefields are typically a source wavefield containing energy from an excited source and a receiver wavefield comprised of scattered-source wavefield energy by the discontinuous earth structure. Shot-profile migration can be recast as a novel way of imaging the earth\\u2019s lithosphere using teleseismic wavefield data, where the source wavefield is the directly arriving wavefront and the receiver wavefield is the following wavefield coda. We demonstrate that the shot-profile technique can be tailored to suit teleseismic acquisition geometry and wavefields. Assuming an acoustic framework and 2.5D experimental geometry, we develop procedures that enable kinematic and structural imaging (migration) using both transmission and free-surface reflected passive wavefields. Experiments with synthetic data demonstrate the method\\u2019s applicability and illustrate the negative imaging consequence of using inaccurate migration velocity profiles. We apply shot-profile migration to a suite of teleseismic events acquired during the IRIS-PASSCAL CASC-1993 experiment in central Oregon. The imaging results are interpreted to show the Juan de Fuca plate subducting beneath the North American plate. We attribute the observed dissimilarities between these results and other Juan de Fuca subduction- zone images to the combination of different imaging goals and the use of more accurate migration velocity profiles.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'Current multiple-removal algorithms in seismic processing use either differential moveout or predictability. If the differential moveout between primaries and multiples is small, prediction is the only option available. In the last decade, multidimensional prediction-error filtering by weighted convolution, such as surface-related multiple elimination (SRME), have proved to be very successful in practice. So far, multiples have been considered as noise and have been discarded after the removal process. In this paper, we argue that multiple reflections contain a wealth of information that can be used in seismic processing to improve the resolution of reservoir images beyond current capability. In the near future, one may expect that the so-called weighted-crosscorrelation (WCC) concept may offer an attractive alternative in approaching the multiple problem. WCC creates an option to avoid the adaptive subtraction process as applied in prediction-error algorithms. Moreover, it allows the transformation of multiples into primaries. The latter means that seismic imaging with primaries and multiples (nonlinear process) can be implemented by a sequence of linear processes, including the transformation of multiples into primaries and the imaging of primaries.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'We describe how vertical seismic profile (VSP) interferometric imaging of transmitted P-to-S (PS) waves can be used to delineate the flanks of salt bodies. Unlike traditional migration methods, interferometric PS imaging does not require the migration velocity model of the salt and/or upper sediments in order to image the salt flank. Synthetic elastic examples show that PS interferometric imaging can clearly delineate the upper and lower boundaries of a realistic salt-body model. Results also show that PS interferometric imaging is noticeably more accurate than conventional migration methods in the presence of static shifts and/or migration velocity errors. However, the illumination area of the PS transmitted waves is limited by the width of the shot and geophone aperture, which means wide shot offsets and deeper receiver wells are needed for comprehensive salt-flank imaging. Interferometric imaging results for VSP data from the Gulf of Mexico demonstrate its superiority over the traditional migration method. We also discuss other arrivals that can be used for interferometric imaging of salt flanks. For comparison, reduced-time migration results are presented, which are similar in quality to those obtained for interferometric imaging. We conclude that PS interferometric imaging of VSP data provides the geophysicist with a new tool by which salt flanks can be viewed from both above and below VSP geophone locations.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'Imaging passive seismic data is the process of synthesizing the wealth of subsurface information available from reflection seismic experiments by recording ambient sound using an array of geophones distributed at the surface. Crosscorrelating the traces of such a passive experiment can synthesize data that are identical to actively collected reflection seismic data. With a correlation-based imaging condition, wave-equation shot-profile depth migration can use raw transmission wavefields as input for producing a subsurface image. Migration is even more important for passively acquired data than for active data because with passive data, the source wavefields are likely to be weak compared with background and instrument noise \\u2014 a condition that leads to a low signal-to-noise ratio. Fourier analysis of correlating long field records shows that aliasing of the wavefields from distinct shots is unavoidable. Although this reduces the order of computations for correlation by the length of the original trace, the aliasing produces an output volume that may not be substantially more useful than the raw data because of the introduction of crosstalk between multiple sources. Direct migration of raw field data still can produce an accurate image, even when the transmission wavefields from individual sources are not separated.

       " {u'abstract': [u'Coherent interferometry is an array-imaging method in which we back-propagate, or migrate, crosscorrelations of the traces over appropriately chosen space-time windows rather than the traces themselves. The size of the space-time windows is critical and depends on two parameters. One is the decoherence frequency, which is proportional to the reciprocal of the delay spread in the traces produced by the clutter. The other is the decoherence length, which also depends on the clutter. As is usual, the clutter is modeled by random fluctuations in the medium properties. In isotropic clutter, the decoherence length is typically much shorter than the array aperture. In layered random media, the decoherence length along the layers can be quite long. We show that when the crosscorrelations of the traces are calculated adaptively, coherent interferometry can provide images that are statistically stable relative to small-scale clutter in the environment. This means that the images we obtain are not sensitive to the detailed form of the clutter. They only depend on its overall statistical properties. However, clutter does reduce the resolution of the images by blurring. We show how the amount of blurring can be minimized by using adaptive interferometric imaging algorithms and discuss the relation between the coherence properties of the array data and the loss in resolution caused by the blurring.'],\n",

We present a selection of these maps that differ in order (i.e., linear or nonlinear), capability, and data requirements. They have their roots in the consideration of a data format known as the T-matrix and have direct applicability to the data construction techniques motivating this special issue. Of particular note, one of these, a construction of the wavefield at any depth (including the transmitted wavefield), order-by-order in the measured reflected wavefield, has an unusual set of capabilities (e.g., it does not involve an assumption regarding the minimum-phase nature of the data and is accomplished with processing in the simple reference medium only) and requirements (e.g., a suite of frequencies from surface data are required to compute a single frequency of the wavefield at depth when the subsurface is unknown). An alternative reflection-to-transmission data mapping (which does not require a knowledge of the wavelet, and in which the component of the unknown medium that is linear in the reflection data is used as a proxy for the component of the unknown medium that is linear in the transmission data) is also derivable from the inverse scattering series framework.'],\n",

A correlation-based redatuming method uses natural-phase information in the data to time shift the weighted traces so they appear to be generated by sources (or recorded by geophones) shifted to a new location. This compares to model-based redatuming, which effectively time shifts the traces using traveltimes computed from a prior velocity model. For wavefield redatuming, the daylight imaging, interferometric imaging, reverse-time acoustics (RTA), and virtual-source methods all require weighted correlation of the traces with one another, followed by summation over all sources (and sometimes receivers). These methods differ from one another by their choice of weights. The least-squares interferometry and virtual-source imaging methods are potentially the most powerful because they account for the limited source and receiver aperture of the recording geometry. Interferometry, on the other hand, has the flexibility to select imaging conditions that target almost any type of event. Stationary-phase principles lead to a Fermat-based redatuming method known as redatuming by a seminatural Green\\u2019s function.

We processed the waves recorded at back positions with respect to the TBM in a manner similar to a RVSP data set obtained by conventional reference-correlation techniques.

We consider two types of teleseismic waves with the presence of the free surface: One is the recorded waves under the real transmission geometry; the other is the constructed waves under a virtual reflection geometry. The theory presented is limited to 1D plane wave acoustic media, but this approximation is reasonable for the teleseismic P-wave problem resulting from the steep emergence angle of the wavefield. Using one-way wavefield reciprocity, we show how the teleseismic reflection responses can be reconstructed from the teleseismic transmission responses. We use the inverse scattering series to remove free-surface multiples from the original transmission data and from the reconstructed reflection response. We derive an alternative algorithm for reconstructing the reflection response from the transmission data that is obtained by taking the difference between the teleseismic transmission waves before and after free-surface multiple removal. Numerical tests with 1D acoustic layered earth models demonstrate the validity of the theory we develop. Noise test shows that the algorithm can work with S/N ratio as low as 5 compared to actual data with S/N ratio from 30 to 50. Testing with elastic synthetic data indicates that the acoustic algorithm is still effective for small incidence angles of typical teleseismic wavefields.'],\n",

We use a representation theorem to derive an expression for the time-reversed wavefield at arbitrary points in the interior. When this expression is used to compute, in a second point, the time-reversed wavefield originating from a point source, the time-reversed Green\\u2019s function between the two points is observed. By invoking reciprocity, we obtain an expression that is suitable for modeling of wave propagation through the medium. From this we develop an efficient and flexible two-stage modeling scheme. In the initial phase, the model is illuminated systematically from a surface surrounding the medium using a sequence of conventional forward-modeling runs. Full waveforms are stored for as many points in the interior as possible. In the second phase, Green\\u2019s functions between arbitrary points in the volume can be computed by crosscorrelation and summation of data computed in the initial phase. We illustrate the method with a simple acoustic example and then apply it to a complex region of the elastic Pluto model. It is particularly efficient when Green\\u2019s functions are desired between a large number of points, but where there are few common source or receiver points. The method relies on interference of multiply scattered waves, but it is stable.

       " {u'abstract': [u'The term seismic interferometry refers to the principle of generating new seismic responses by crosscorrelating seismic observations at different receiver locations. The first version of this principle was derived by Claerbout (1968), who showed that the reflection response of a horizontally layered medium can be synthesized from the autocorrelation of its transmission response. For an arbitrary 3D inhomogeneous lossless medium it follows from Rayleigh\\u2019s reciprocity theorem and the principle of time-reversal invariance that the acoustic Green\\u2019s function between any two points in the medium can be represented by an integral of crosscorrelations of wavefield observations at those two points. The integral is along sources on an arbitrarily shaped surface enclosing these points. No assumptions are made with respect to the diffusivity of the wavefield. The Rayleigh-Betti reciprocity theorem leads to a similar representation of the elastodynamic Green\\u2019s function. When a part of the enclosing surface is the earth\\u2019s free surface, the integral needs only to be evaluated over the remaining part of the closed surface. In practice, not all sources are equally important: The main contributions to the reconstructed Green\\u2019s function come from sources at stationary points. When the sources emit transient signals, a shaping filter can be applied to correct for the differences in source wavelets. When the sources are uncorrelated noise sources, the representation simplifies to a direct crosscorrelation of wavefield observations at two points, similar as in methods that retrieve Green\\u2019s functions from diffuse wavefields in disordered media or in finite media with an irregular bounding surface.'],\n",

We estimate a near-surface scattering distribution from a subset of a data record and use this scattering distribution to predict the secondary waves of the entire data record with a wave-theoretical model for near-receiver scattering. We then subtract the predicted scattered waves from the record to obtain the wavefield that would have been measured in the absence of near-surface heterogeneities. We apply this method to part of a field data set acquired in an area with significant near-surface heterogeneity. The main result of our processing scheme is that we effectively remove near-surface scattered waves. This, in turn, increases trace-to-trace coherence of reflection events. Moreover, application of our method improves the results obtained from just an application of a dip filter because we remove parts of the scattered wave with apparent velocities that are typically accepted by the pass zone of the dip filter.

The identification of reflector terminations and subtle changes in dip and azimuth allows us to infer coherent progradational and transgressive packages as well as more chaotic slumps, fans, and braided-stream complexes; infill of karsted terrains; gas seeps; and, of course, faults and angular unconformities. A major difficulty in estimating reflector dip and azimuth arises at discrete lateral and vertical discontinuities across which reflector dip and azimuth change. The smearing across these boundaries produced by traditional dip and azimuth estimations is avoided by using temporally and spatially shifted multiple windows that contain each analysis point. This more robust estimation of dip and azimuth leads to increased resolution of well-established algorithms such as coherence, coherent amplitude gradients, and structurally oriented filtering. More promising still is the analysis of high-resolution dip and azimuth through volumetric estimates of reflector curvature and angular unconformities. This new technique is demonstrated using two land data volumes, one from the Louisiana salt province and the other from the fractured Fort Worth basin.'],\n",

We partition the fault surfaces into relatively small linear portions, which are identified by analyzing tilted and rotated subvolumes throughout the region of interest. Directional filtering and thresholding further enhance the seismic discontinuities that are attributable to fault surfaces. Subsequently, the volume of LFE estimates is skeletonized, and individual fault surfaces are extracted and labeled in the order of decreasing size.

The dips are then resolved into time shifts (or depth shifts) using a nonlinear Gauss-Newton iterative approach that exploits fast Fourier transforms to minimize computation time. To handle faults (discontinuous reflections), we apply a weighted inversion scheme. The weight identifies locations of faults, allowing dips to be summed around the faults to reduce the influence of erroneous dip estimates near the fault. If a fault model is not provided, we can estimate a suitable weight (essentially a fault indicator) within our inversion using an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) method.

       " {u'abstract': [u'A methodology is presented for vector analysis of the image displacements (warping) between successive 3D seismic image volumes that provides 7D analysis (including lateral and vertical displacements) of in situ subsurface deformation around hydrocarbon reservoirs. The key challenges are (1) assessment of just vertical shifts is insufficient, and vector displacements should be determined; (2) robust vertical displacements can usually be derived, but lateral shifts are less well defined because of the generally smooth data character in a horizontal/horizon plane; (3) subvoxel resolution is necessary for correct matching and deformation analysis; (4) velocity and strain effects are intrinsically combined in time-lapse seismic images; (5) separation of accumulated and local effects is necessary; (6) apparently coherent and smooth displacement fields do not necessarily provide good strain analysis; (7) warping is easily degraded by noise, and good cross-matching is a prerequisite. To address these challenges, a full 3D, local warp vector derivation methodology is proposed, which involves (1) constraint using prior estimates, (2) local refinement with subvoxel resolution, and (3) 3D and vectorial conditioning using a deformable mesh with sensitivity to image-match quality. The warping approach is extended to separate accumulated from local effects and to analyze in situ deformation based on the displacement vector volume. This is achieved by a finite-element approach to determine an elemental pseudostrain tensor field and an iterative procedure to separate the pseudostrain into velocity and strain components. The approach up to the strain analysis, is demonstrated using a real data example, which indicates the potential of the methodology (accumulated overburden effects are separated to reveal a local compaction signature in the reservoir), but realistic, quantitative values of strain have not yet been realized.'],\n",

Consequently, it is very difficult to appraise the changes in petrophysical reservoir parameters over time. We introduce a 4D monitoring approach based on the spectral ratio method. This method produces two time-lapse attributes: the relative change in reflection coefficient and the traveltime shift at reflecting interfaces. These attributes can be used for appraising production-related changes in the subsurface. The approach corrects for time-invariant nonrepeatability effects in the overburden and source-receiver coupling problems in time-lapse surveys. The validity of the method is limited to structurally simple overburden and reservoirs with weak lateral variations.

Compensation for attenuation during migration implies applying a gain that can make the numerical algorithm unstable. We introduce a homogeneous plane-wave approximation that gives greater stability to the migration technique, allowing a stable and satisfactory migration of the GPR data up to depths equivalent to three times the skin depth computed at the dominant frequency of the radar signal. Multiple slowness references of split-step migration for lossy media are introduced and compared with the single-reference slowness technique.

We use the fact that, because of the imaginary part of the electric conductivity, polarized media support wave propagation processes whose nature is similar to displacement currents induced by the dielectric permittivity. However, unlike displacement currents, these processes reveal themselves at much lower frequencies and, therefore, at greater depths. It is established that the ratio of the second and the first differences of the electric potential does not decay after the current turn-off in polarized media, whereas it decays quickly if the IP effect is absent. Thus, the IP response can be observed directly and separated from the electromagnetic (EM) response.

Permanent current electrodes are emplaced in the subsurface and used to inject current into the subsurface region of interest. The resultant potential fields are measured using a surface reference electrode and an electrode mounted on a cone penetrometer. The standard suite of cone penetration measurements, including high-resolution resistivity logs, are also obtained and are an integral part of the C-bert method. C-bert data are inverted using an inexact Gauss-Newton algorithm to produce a 3D electrical conductivity map. A majorchallenge with the inversion is the large local perturbation around the measurement location, due to the highly conductive cone. As the cone is small with respect to the total model space, explicit modeling of the cone is cost prohibitive. We have developed a rapid method for solving the forward model which uses iteratively determined boundary conditions (IDBC). This allows us to generate a computationally feasible, preinversion correction for the cone perturbation. We assessed C-bert by performing a field test to image the conductivity structure of the Kidd 2 site near Vancouver, British Columbia. A total of nine permanent current electrodes were emplaced and five C-bert data sets were obtained, resulting in 6516 data points.

The methodology is based on the time evolution of the spatial distributions of fluid saturation and salt concentration attributed to mud-filtrate invasion. We use a rigorous formulation to account for the physics of fluid displacement in porous media resulting from water-base mud filtrate invading hydrocarbon-bearing rock formations. Borehole array-induction measurements are simulated in a coupled mode with the physics of fluid flow. We use inversion to estimate parametric 1D distributions of permeability and porosity that honor the measured array-induction logs. As a byproduct, the inversion yields 2D (axial-symmetric) spatial distributions of aqueous phase saturation, salt concentration, and electrical resistivity. We conduct numerical inversion experiments using noisy synthetic wireline logs. The inversion requires a priori knowledge of several mud, petrophys-ical, and fluid parameters. We perform a systematic study of the accuracy and reliability of the estimated values of porosity and permeability when knowledge of such parameters is uncertain. For the numerical cases considered in this paper, inversion results indicate that borehole electromagnetic-induction logs with multiple radial lengths of investigation (array-induction logs) enable the accurate and reliable estimation of layer-by-layer absolute permeability and porosity. The accuracy of the estimated values of porosity and permeability is higher than 95% in the presence of 5% measurement noise and 10% uncertainty in rock-fluid and mud parameters. However, for cases of deep invasion beyond the radial length of investigation of array-induction logging tools, the estimation of permeability becomes unreliable. We emphasize the importance of a sensitivity study prior to inversion to rule out potential biases in estimating permeability resulting from uncertain knowledge about rock-fluid and mud properties.'],\n",

Instead, a range of empirical models are usually employed. We propose a new model that has been derived analytically from electrokinetic theory and is equally valid for all lithologies. The predictions of the new model and four other common models (Kozeny-Carman, Berg, Swanson, and van Baaren) have been compared using measurements carried out on fused and unfused glass bead packs as well as on 91 rock samples representing 11 lithologies and three coring directions. The new model provides the best predictions for the glass bead packs as well for all the lithologies. The crux of the new model is to have a good knowledge of the relevant mean grain diameter, for example, from MICP data. Hence, we have also predicted the permeabilities of 21 North Sea well cores using all five models and five different measures of relevant grain size.

Stereotomography is a tomographic method that uses local dip estimates in addition to traveltimes for velocity model estimation. We present a new methodology for velocity model updating. It combines poststack stereotomography and residual moveout velocity inversion. The former is used for initial model construction and the latter for updating the velocity model. Residual inversion is a kind of stereotomographic inversion applied to common reflection point (CRP) gathers after model-based moveout correction. Velocity analysis can be made more efficient by preselecting the traces that contribute to a series of CRP gathers and using only these traces for inversion. The algorithm is defined in a two-step procedure. First, ray tracing from the reflection point for nonzero reflection offsets defines the source and receiver locations of the data traces in the CRS gather. Then these traces are moveout corrected according to the calculated traveltimes and residual moveout is estimated. The interval velocity model is updated by fitting the velocity that minimizes estimated residuals. Application of the proposed technique demonstrates its robustness and reliability for fast and automatic velocity model estimation.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'There are similarities and differences in employing amplitude variation with offset (AVO) to explore for gas-sand reservoirs, as opposed to coal-bed methane (CBM) reservoirs. The main similarity is that large Poisson\\u2019s ratio contrasts, resulting in AVO gradient anomalies, are expected for both kinds of reservoirs. The main difference is that cleating and fracturing raise the Poisson\\u2019s ratio of a coal seam as it improves its reservoir potential for CBM, while gas always lowers the Poisson\\u2019s ratio of a sandstone reservoir. The top of gas sands usually has a negative AVO gradient, leading to a class one, two, or three anomaly depending on the impedance contrast with the overlying caprock. On the other hand, the top of a CBM reservoir has a positive AVO gradient, leading to a class four anomaly. Three environmental factors may limit the usage of AVO for CBM reservoirs: the smaller contrast in Poisson\\u2019s ratio between a CBM reservoir and its surrounding rock, variations in the caprock of a specific CBM reservoir, and the fact that CBM is not always free to collect at structurally high points in the reservoir. However, other factors work in favor of using AVO. The strikingly high reflection amplitude of coal improves signal/noise ratio and hence the reliability of AVO measurements. The relatively simple characteristics of AVO anomalies make them easy to interpret. Because faults are known to improve the quality of CBM reservoirs, faults accompanied by AVO anomalies would be especially convincing. A 3D-AVO example offered in this paper shows that AVO might be helpful to delineate methane-rich sweet spots within coal seams.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'We present two approaches to invert geophysical measurements and estimate subsurface properties and their uncertainties when little is known a priori about the size of the errors associated with the data. We illustrate these approaches by inverting first-arrival traveltimes of seismic waves measured in a vertical well to infer the variation of compressional slowness in depth. First, we describe a Bayesian formulation based on probability distributions that define prior knowledge about the slowness and the data errors. We use an empirical Bayes approach, where hyperparameters are not well known ahead of time (e.g., the variance of the data errors) and are estimated from their most probable value, given the data. The second approach is a non-Bayesian formulation that we call spectral, in the sense that it uses the power spectral density of the traveltime data to constrain the inversion (e.g., to estimate the variance of the data errors). In the spectral approach, we vary assumptions made about the characteristics of the slowness signal and evaluate the resulting slowness estimates and their uncertainties. This approach is computationally simple and starts from a few assumptions. These assumptions can be checked during the analysis. On the other hand, it requires evenly spaced traveltime measurements, and it cannot be extended easily (e.g., to data that have gaps). In contrast, the Bayesian framework is based on a general theory that can be generalized immediately, but it is more involved computationally. Despite the conceptual and practical differences, we find that the two approaches give the same results when they start from the same assumptions: The allegiance to a Bayesian or non-Bayesian formulation matters less than what one is willing to assume when solving the inverse problem.'],\n",

Several tests are performed in order to investigate the behavior of the present method for resolution improvement and noise suppression. Applications on both 1D and 2D synthetic data show that the method is capable of reducing the amplitudes and temporal widths of the side lobes of the input wavelets, and hence, the spectral bandwidth of the input seismic data is enhanced, resulting in an improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio. The bright-spot anomalies observed on the stacked sections become clearer because the output seismic traces have a simplified appearance allowing an easier data interpretation.

       " {u'abstract': [u'Complex-trace analysis is the method of choice for analyzing polarized data. Because particle motion can be represented by instantaneous attributes that show distinct features for waves of different polarization characteristics, it can be used to separate and characterize these waves. Traditional methods of complex-trace analysis only give the instantaneous attributes as a function of time or frequency. However, for transient wave types or seismic events that overlap in time, an estimate of the polarization parameters requires analysis of the time-frequency dependence of these attributes. We propose a method to map instantaneous polarization attributes of seismic signals in the wavelet domain and explicitly relate these attributes with the wavelet-transform coefficients of the analyzed signal. We compare our method with traditional complex-trace analysis using numerical examples. An advantage of our method is its possibility of performing the complete wave-mode separation/filtering process in the wavelet domain and its ability to provide the frequency dependence of ellipticity, which contains important information on the subsurface structure. Furthermore, using 2-C synthetic and real seismic shot gathers, we show how to use the method to separate different wave types and identify zones of interfering wave modes.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'Wave-equation-based redatuming is expensive and requires a detailed knowledge of the shallow velocity field. We derive the analytical expression of a new prestack wavefield extrapolation operator, the Topographic Datuming Operator (TDO), which applies redatuming based on straight-rays approximation above and below a chosen datum. This redatuming operator is directly applied to common-source gathers to downward continue the source and the receivers, simultaneously, to the datum level without resorting to common-receiver gathers. As a result, the method is far more efficient and robust than the conventional wave-equation-based redatuming and does not require an accurate depth-domain interval velocity model. In addition, TDO, unlike wave-equation-based redatuming, requires effective velocities above datum, and thus can be applied using attributes valid for static correction methods. Effective velocities beneath the datum permit us to replace the surface integral, which is needed for wave-equation redatuming with a line integral. In the particular case of infinite (in practice, very high with respect to the shallow layers) velocity beneath the datum, the TDO impulse response collapses to a point, and TDO redatuming is equivalent to conventional static correction, which may, therefore, be regarded as a special case of the newly derived operator. The computational cost of applying TDO is slightly larger than static corrections, yet provides higher quality results partially attributable to the ability of TDO to suppress diffractions emanating from anomalies above datum. Since TDO is an operation based on geometrical optics approximation, velocity after TDO is not biased by the vertical shift correction associated with conventional static correction. Application to a synthetic data set demonstrates the features of the method.'],\n",

The local interval-velocity adjustments for each CRP are obtained by maximizing the stack amplitude over the predicted (nonhyperbolic) moveout in each CRP gather; this does not involve retracing rays. At every iteration, the velocity in each pixel is updated by averaging over all the predicted velocity updates. Finally, CRP positions and orientations are updated by parsimonious migration, and rays are retraced to define new CRP gathers for the next iteration; this ensures internal consistency between the updated velocity model and the CRP gather.

Using an optimization scheme, the coefficients in the cascaded operator are determined according to the local velocity distribution and the prescribed angular range of wavefield propagation. The proposed algorithm is implemented alternately in spatial and wavenumber domains using fast Fourier transforms, as in the split-step Fourier and generalized-screen methods.

Therefore, no anisotropy effect is taken into consideration. Using the matrix-propagator method, we derive equations for transmission and reflection responses from the stack of horizontal layers. From the transmission response, we compute the phase velocity and compare the zero-frequency limit with the effective-medium velocity from Backus averaging. We also investigate how the transition from time-average medium to effective medium depends on contrast; i.e., strength of the reflection-coefficient series. Using numerical examples, we show that a transition zone exists between the effective medium (low-frequency limit) and the time-average medium (high-frequency limit), and that the width of this zone depends on the strength of the reflection-coefficient series.'],\n",

The model inherits the properties of a medium with linear-velocity variation in depth in the shallow zone and of a medium with constant velocity in the deep zone. Two types of rays departing from the source point on the earth\\u2019s surface exist in this model, depending on the takeoff angles. The rays of the first kind are symmetric arcs that return up to the earth\\u2019s surface and have a limited maximum depth of propagation. The rays of the second kind propagate down to infinite depth. In the shallow region, they are curved lines, but at large depth they become asymptotically straight. The form of the ray is governed by the takeoff angle at the source point, where a critical angle splits the two kinds of rays. This critical angle depends only on the ratio between the velocity at the source point and the asymptotic velocity of the EAB model. We derive the formulae required to calculate the two kinds of rays and solve the inverse problem of two-point ray tracing. Finally, we construct the 2D- and 3D-isochron surfaces for a finite offset.'],\n",

Interfaces between blocks are triangulated to prevent overlaps or gaps often produced by other techniques, such as B-splines, and to speed up the calculation of intersection points between a ray and block interfaces. We also use a smoothing algorithm to make the normal vector of each triangle continuous at the boundary, so that ray tracing can be performed with stability and accuracy. Based on Fermat\\u2019s principle, we perturb an initial raypath between two points, generally obtained by shooting, with a segmentally iterative ray-tracing (SIRT) method. Intersection points on a ray are updated in sequence, instead of simultaneously, because the number of new intersection points may be increased or decreased during the iteration process. To improve convergence speed, we update the intersection points by a first-order explicit formula instead of traditional iterative methods. Only transmitted and reflected waves are considered. Numerical tests demonstrate that the combination of block modeling and segmentally iterative ray tracing is effective in implementing kinematic two-point ray tracing in complex 3D media.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'We present a new approach to the design and implementation of explicit wavefield extrapolation for seismic depth migration in the space-frequency domain. Instability of the wavefield extrapolation operator is addressed by splitting the operator into two parts, one to control phase accuracy and a second to improve stability. The first partial operator is simply a windowed version of the exact operator for a half step. The second partial operator is designed, using the Wiener filter method, as a band-limited, least-squares inverse of the first. The final wavefield extrapolation operator for a full step is formed as a convolution of the first partial operator with the complex conjugate of the second. This resulting wavefield extrapolation operator can be designed to have any desired length and is generally more stable and more accurate than a simple windowed operator of similar length. Additional stability is gained by reducing the amount of evanescent filtering and by spatially downsampling the lower temporal frequencies. The amount of evanescent filtering is controlled by building two operator tables, one corresponding to significant evanescent filtering and the other to very little evanescent filtering. During the wavefield extrapolation process, most steps are taken with the second table while the first is invoked only for roughly every tenth step. Also, the data are divided into frequency partitions that are optimally resampled in the spatial coordinates to further enhance the performance of the extrapolation operator. Lower frequencies are downsampled to a larger spatial sample size. Testing of the algorithm shows accurate, high-angle impulse responses and run times comparable to the phase shift method of time migration. Images from trial depth migrations of the Marmousi model show very high resolution.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'A new partial-prestack migration operator to manipulate multicomponent data, called converted-wave azimuth moveout (PS-AMO), transforms converted-wave prestack data with an arbitrary offset and azimuth to equivalent data with a new offset and azimuth position. This operator is a sequential application of converted-wave dip moveout and its inverse. As expected, PS-AMO reduces to the known expression of AMO for the extreme case when the P velocity is the same as the S velocity. Moreover, PS-AMO preserves the resolution of dipping events and internally applies a correction for the lateral shift between the common-midpoint and the common-reflection/conversion point. An implementation of PS-AMO in the log-stretch frequency-wavenumber domain is computationally efficient. The main applications for the PS-AMO operator are geometry regularization, data-reduction through partial stacking, and interpolation of unevenly sampled data. We test our PS-AMO operator by solving 3D acquisition geometry-regularization problems for multicomponent, ocean-bottom seismic data. The geometry-regularization problem is defined as a regularized least-squares-objective function. To preserve the resolution of dipping events, the regularization term uses the PS-AMO operator. Application of this methodology on a portion of the Alba 3D, multicomponent, ocean-bottom seismic data set shows that we can satisfactorily obtain an interpolated data set that honors the physics of converted waves.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'A new, fast inversion approach for time-lapse seismic data is developed where the uncertainty of the inversion results is an integral part of the solution. The inversion method estimates changes in the elastic material properties of a reservoir because of production of hydrocarbons, including uncertainty bounds on these estimates. The changes in elastic properties then can be related to changes in hydrocarbon saturation and reservoir pressure by using rock-physics relations. The inversion operates directly on the difference between a repeat survey and a baseline survey. This is advantageous with respect to the uncertainty calculation, because an estimate of the seismic uncertainty can be obtained directly from the difference data in zones not affected by production. The method is formulated in a Bayesian setting, and the solution is represented by explicit expressions for the posterior expectation and the covariance of the elastic parameter changes. The explicit analytical form of the posterior distribution provides a computationally fast inversion method.

As an alternative to classical waveform inversion, we propose the use of a new, objective function constructed by taking the logarithm of wavefields, allowing consideration of three types of objective function, namely, amplitude only, phase only, or both. In our wave form inversion, we estimate the source signature as well as the velocity structure by including functions of amplitudes and phases of the source signature in the objective function. We compute the steepest-descent directions by using a matrix formalism derived from a frequency-domain, finite-element/finite-difference modeling technique. Our numerical algorithms are similar to those of reverse-time migration and waveform inversion based on the adjoint state of the wave equation. In order to demonstrate the practical applicability of our algorithm, we use a synthetic data set from the Marmousi model and seismic data collected from the Korean continental shelf. For noise-free synthetic data, the velocity structure produced by our inversion algorithm is closer to the true velocity structure than that obtained with conventional waveform inversion.

When ray-angle coverage is narrow, cell or grid tomography can be plagued by smearing artifacts bearing imprints of the raypaths. Multiscale deformable-layer tomography (DLT), which inverts for the geometry of velocity interfaces instead of velocity, can be more effective than grid-based tomography in mitigating such artifacts, especially when velocity values are known for parts of the model. The DLT model consists of geologically sensible layers represented by triangular prisms. In areas of good ray coverage, DLT can be used to invert simultaneously for layer velocities as well as interface geometry.

The P-wave induces a fluid-pressure difference at mesoscopic-scale inhomogeneities (larger than the pore size but smaller than the wavelength, typically tens of centimeters) and generates fluid flow and slow (diffusion) Biot waves (continuity of pore pressure is achieved by energy conversion to slow P-waves, which diffuse away from the interfaces). In this context, we consider a periodically stratified medium and investigate the amount of attenuation (and velocity dispersion) caused by different types of heterogeneities in the rock properties, namely, porosity, grain and frame moduli, permeability, and fluid properties. The most effective loss mechanisms result from porosity variations and partial saturation, where one of the fluids is very stiff and the other is very compliant, such as, a highly permeable sandstone at shallow depths, saturated with small amounts of gas (around 10% saturation) and water. Grain- and frame-moduli variations are the next cause of attenuation. The relaxation peak moves towards low frequencies as the (background) permeability decreases and the viscosity and thickness of the layers increase.

       " {u'abstract': [u'Linear anomalies are critical in the interpretation of gravity and magnetic data. Visual identification of lineaments is usually done by experienced interpreters, and identification results then have to undergo a digitization or import procedure. The traditional identification method has unavoidable subjectivity and inefficiency. To overcome these limitations, we fuse the Radon transform (RT) with gradient calculation to process gravity or magnetic data and to realize automatic detection and extraction of lineaments. As part of the detection procedure, we define the RT-based mean gradient (MG), effective mean gradient (EMG), and residual mean gradient (RMG) in order to highlight long linear segments or to enhance short linear ones in the transform domain. The gradient forms are applied self-adaptively and self-selectively to gravity or magnetic images according to specific conditions. Gradient directions are also taken into account in the transformation procedure to emphasize the characteristics of linear anomalies. To extract the position and length of the detected lineaments from the transform domain, a constraint inverse searching method (CISM) is given and used to locate the starting and end points of the lineaments. The method can deal with the condition that there is at least one linear section in a specific direction or that separate linear sections may belong to one lineament. Through tests with synthetic images and with real data from the Haijiao upheaval area in the East China Sea Basin, the detection and extraction methods are shown to be more effective and robust than the conventional RT applications. The results from the real data roughly coincide with major geologic faults that are visually identified.

Validation of the theory is achieved using specially designed field-scale experiments carried out with a CR instrument capable of measuring the full complex transfer impedance. At intermediate dipole separations, the results are consistent with the predictions of quasi-static theory. Deviations observed in the near and far separation zones can be explained by geometric effects or the breakdown of quasi-static conditions, respectively.

This study is part of a project to improve current longterm monitoring routines and data interpretation and increasing the understanding when interpreting existing data. This is accomplished by modeling various occurrences typical of embankment structures using properties from two rockfill embankment dams with central till cores in the north of Sweden. The study evaluates the influence from 3D effects created by specific dam geometry and effects of water level fluctuations in the reservoir. Moreover, a comparison between different layout locations is carried out, and detectability of internal erosion scenarios is estimated through modeling of simulated damage situations. Software was especially developed to model apparent resistivity for geometries and material distributions for embankment dams. The model shows that the 3D effect from the embankment geometry is clearly significant when measuring along dam crests. For dams constructed with a conductive core of fine-grained soil and high-resistive rockfill, the effect becomes greatly enhanced. Also, water level fluctuations have a clear effect on apparent resistivities. Only small differences were found between the investigated arrays. A layout along the top of the crest is optimal for monitoring on existing dams, where intrusive investigations are normally avoided, because it is important to pass the current through the conductive core, which is often the main target of investigation. The investigation technique has proven beneficial for improving monitoring routines and increasing the understanding of results from the ongoing monitoring programs.

       " {u'abstract': [u'In the finite-difference (FD) method, one solves a set of discrete approximations to continuous differential equations; thus, the solutions only approximate the true values. For the magnetotelluric (MT) method, errors in the electric and magnetic fields computed by the staggered FD method are precisely quantifiable for a model with uniform conductivity. In this case, the errors in the electric and magnetic fields are equal in magnitude but increase with rising node separation. In this paper, I show that errors in MT responses, which rely on ratios of the field values, depend strongly on the method used to interpolate electric field values to the surface where the magnetic field is sampled. Analytic expressions for the FD estimates of the MT responses for a half-space are derived and compared for three different methods of electric field interpolation. The best results are achieved when the electric field values just above and below the surface are interpolated exponentially. For a half-space, the FD estimates of the MT responses are independent of node separation and are precisely equal to the analytic values when the electric field is interpolated exponentially. For models with sharp conductivity contrasts, the errors in the responses derived using this interpolation method increase with rising node spacing but still perform better than other examined interpolation methods. Varying the vertical node separation within a half-space model degrades the solution accuracy. The magnitude of the error depends primarily on the magnitude of the change in vertical node spacing. Lateral variations in the grid spacing do not necessarily yield errors in the FD solutions to the MT equations.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'Two important mechanisms affect our ability to estimate solute concentrations quantitatively from the inversion of field-scale electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) data: (1) the spatially variable physical processes that govern the flow of current as well as the variation of physical properties in space and (2) the overparameterization of inverse models, which requires the imposition of a smoothing constraint (regularization) to facilitate convergence of the inverse solution. Based on analyses of field and synthetic data, we find that the ability of ERT to recover the 3D shape and magnitudes of a migrating conductive target is spatially variable. Additionally, the application of Archie\\u2019s law to tomograms from field ERT data produced solute concentrations that are consistently less than 10% of point measurements collected in the field and estimated from transport modeling. Estimates of concentration from ERT using Archie\\u2019s law only fit measured solute concentrations if the apparent formation factor is varied with space and time and allowed to take on unreasonably high values. Our analysis suggests that the inability to find a single petrophysical relation in space and time between concentration and electrical resistivity is largely an effect of two properties of ERT surveys: (1) decreased sensitivity of ERT to detect the target plume with increasing distance from the electrodes and (2) the smoothing imprint of regularization used in inversion.'],\n",

Apparent resistivity, derived from the observed azimuthal component of the magnetic field, often is used as an approximation to the resistivity of a layered earth. Two commonly used formulas to compute the apparent resistivity have their own limitations and are invalid for a deep-sea experiment. In this paper, we derive an apparent-resistivity formula based upon the magnetic field resulting from a semi-infinite electrode buried in a 1D layered earth. This new formula can be applied to both shallow and deep marine MMR surveys. In addition, we address the effects that arise from the transmitter-receiver (Tx-Rx) depth difference and the choice of the normalized range (the radial distance between transmitter and receiver, divided by the thickness of seawater) on data interpretation and survey design.

       " {u'abstract': [u'We present a mathematical analysis of borehole stability when drilling through rock salt. First, we consider an elastic transversely isotropic medium and find the optimal mud weight as a function of the vertical overburden and horizontal tectonic stresses. Then, the Zener and Maxwell mechanical models are used to model the effects of transient and steady-state creep flow, respectively, in isotropic media. Under certain conditions such as the absence of dilatational anelasticity, the Burger model can be used to describe the steady-state flow, including transient creep effects. The type of creep is regulated by critical octahedral-stress values that depend on temperature and pressure. A typical drilling results in conditions of plane strain, whose solution is given by Kirsch\\u2019s equations. In this case, the borehole is subject to minimum and maximum horizontal stresses, which differ from the vertical stress. The analysis provides expressions for the shape of the borehole-cross section, the borehole-wall closure time, and the optimal mud weight to avoid wall collapse or expansion. It is shown that an anisotropic state of tectonic stress may require mud pressures exceeding the overburden stress and that the calculation should consider the joint optimization of the shape and area of the borehole cross section.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'The wide success of 2D surface-related multiple elimination (SRME) in attenuating complex multiples in many cases has spurred efforts to apply the method in three dimensions. However, application of 3D SRME to conventional marine data is often impeded by severe crossline aliasing characteristic of marine acquisition geometries. We propose to overcome this limitation using a dip-moveout (DMO)-based procedure consisting of the following steps: resorting the data into common offsets to improve crossline sampling, performing DMO to eliminate azimuth variations in the common-offset domain, and efficiently implementing inverse shot-record DMO to reconstruct densely sampled shot records required for 3D SRME to predict multiples correctly. We use a field data example to demonstrate that the proposed shot reconstruction procedure leads to kinematically accurate reconstruction of primaries but may not be able to simultaneously position multiples correctly. The mispositioning of multiples becomes a problem when second- and higher-order multiples must be predicted. We propose to resolve this difficulty by using a layer-stripping approach to multiple prediction. Alternatively, an approximate algorithm that relies on adaptive subtraction to compensate for inaccurate positioning of predicted multiples can be used. Application of the latter approach is illustrated with a field data example, and its performance is evaluated quantitatively through a measurement of S/N ratio improvement. We demonstrate that a DMO-based implementation of 3D SRME outperforms conventional 2D SRME and can accurately predict and attenuate complex 3D multiples.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u\"As geophysicists rely increasingly on effective media theories to characterize naturally fractured reservoirs, they become more and more interested in evaluating the accuracy of different theories, estimating their limits of applicability, and assessing their usefulness for practice. With this in mind, we compare two popular seismological theories of Hudson and Schoenberg with the theory of Kachanov developed in the context of mechanics of materials. By performing finite-element simulations of effective media for models that contain several sets of nonintersecting, circular, vertical fractures embedded in otherwise isotropic host rock, we examine the accuracy of these theories. Our numeric study reveals that predictions of both the first- and second-order Hudson's theories are typically inferior to those of others, especially when the fractures are dry. While, on average, the theories of Schoenberg and Kachanov fit finite-element computations with comparable accuracy, the latter appears to be more useful for fracture characterization. The reason is thatit correctly predicts the proximity of crack-induced anisotropy to orthotropy, whereas the other theories do not. Kachanov's results not only yield approximate effective orthotropy regardless of the number of fracture sets, their crack densities, and orientations, but they also lead to a substantially reduced number of independent parameters that govern the effective stiffnesses. This number is only four for dry cracks, compared to nine required for general orthorhombic media. These four quantities can be chosen as two Lam\\xe9 constants of the isotropic background and two principal crack densities. If fractures are filled with a compressible fluid, the number of independent parameters increases. After numeric verification of the accuracy of crack-induced orthotropy, we invert the NMO ellipses and zero-offset traveltimes of P-waves and two split shear waves for the parameters characterizing multiple fracture sets. Our inversion reveals the fracture parameters that can be unambiguously estimated from multiazimuth, multicomponent surface reflection data.\"],\n",

We have developed a new joint-inversion algorithm to estimate reservoir parameters directly, using both seismic amplitude variation with angle of incidence (AVA) data and marine controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) data. Reservoir parameters are linked to geophysical parameters through a rock-properties model. Errors in the parameters of the rock-properties model introduce errors of comparable size in the reservoir-parameter estimates produced by joint inversion. Tests of joint inversion on synthetic 1D models demonstrate improved fluid saturation and porosity estimates for joint AVA-CSEM data inversion (compared with estimates from AVA or CSEM inversion alone). A comparison of inversions of AVA data, CSEM data, and joint AVA-CSEM data over the North Sea Troll field, at a location for which we have well control, shows that the joint inversion produces estimates of gas saturation, oil saturation, and porosity that are closest (as measured by the rms difference, the  ',\n",

The geophysical results were ground-truthed in seven locations by archaeological excavation. Geophysical results demonstrated that (1) the distribution of remaining original soils could be mapped; (2) waste materials (e.g., slag, used brick, burned charcoal, iron ore, and broken-up sandstone or limestone) within or above the original soils could be detected and delineated, whether the material occurred in pits or lenses or was dispersed across the ground surface; and (3) the location and spatial extent of many former structures related to furnace operation could be identified, such as building or bridge foundations and casting-related structures (e.g., the tapping channel or the casting floor, and the former courses of a water canal (raceway) and a supply road).

The technique may be applied in real time to either continuous data or detected-event data for a number of three-component receivers and does not require prior information such as P- or S-wave time picks. Peak crosscorrelation coefficients, evaluated in the frequency domain, are used as the basis for identifying microseismic doublets. The peak crosscorrelation coefficient at each receiver is evaluated with a weighted arithmetic average of the normalized correlation coefficients of each component. Each component is weighted by the maximum amplitude of the signal for that component to reduce the effect of noise on the calculations. The weighted average correlations are averaged over all receivers in a time window centered on a fixed lag time. The size of the time window is determined from the dominant period in the signal, and the lag time is the time that maximizes the average correlation coefficient. The technique is applied to a three-component passive seismic data set recorded at the Valhall field, North Sea. A large number of microseismic doublets are identified that can be grouped into multiplets, reducing the total number of absolute event locations by a factor of two. Seven large multiplets reflect the repeated multiple rerupturing (up to 30 times on a single fault) and significant stress release.

Existing surface-consistent deconvolution techniques that account for these effects assume that common-midpoint (CMP) gathering is valid \\u2014 the seismic trace is decomposed into a source function, a receiver response, a normal-incidence reflectivity term, and an offset-related component that is laterally shift invariant. As a result, the performance of existing surface-consistent deconvolution techniques is best when applied to primary reflection data only, since the offset dependency of ground roll and multiples varies laterally in media with lateral variations. We have developed an alternative method for surface-consistent deconvolution that is applicable to the entire seismic trace and is therefore essentially a raw-data preprocessing step. The method is based on reciprocity of the medium response. Assuming that conditions for applicability of reciprocity are met, we can attribute differences between normal and reciprocal recordings to the source and receiver perturbations. Contrary to existing surface-consistent deconvolution methods, this approach uses the full description of the wavefield and is therefore ideally suited for prestack processing. We have applied this technique to single-sensor data acquired in Manistee County, Michigan. At this site, near-surface conditions vary, and this significantly affects data quality. The application of the new deconvolution procedure substantially improves S/N ratio on both prestack and poststack data, and these results compare favorably to those obtained using existing surface-consistent deconvolution techniques, since they require subjective data scaling to obtain acceptable results. The obtained source corrections are correlated to changes in near-surface conditions \\u2014 in this case, to changes in water-saturation levels. We do not observe such a correlation for the receiver corrections, which vary rapidly along the spread. Finally, the receiver response does not agree with the generally accepted damped harmonic oscillator model. For frequencies below 100 Hz, the retrieved receiver variations are larger than predicted by this model, and we cannot explain the receiver response using a single resonant frequency for the geophone-ground coupling.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'The elastic properties of sand strongly depend on the grains\\u2019 contact stiffness, which can be increased significantly by solid matter and, depending on frequency, viscous fluid acting as contact cement. To calculate seismic velocities in precompacted fluid-cemented sand, we examine how a small amount of viscous fluid at the grain contacts influences their normal and tangential stiffnesses as a function of effective pressure. Using the Hertz-Mindlin approach and considering oscillatory loading in addition to precompaction of a combination of two elastic spheres, we extend the dry-contact elastic theory by a viscoelastic formulation. Here, we describe the radial flow of the fluid cement induced by the oscillations of the grains\\u2019 surfaces around the direct contact, a process that leads to a complex normal stiffness and stiffness/frequency dispersion. In the resulting combined model, the low-frequency real part of the complex normal stiffness identical is to the original Hertz-Mindlin expression. The magnitude of the dispersion is governed by the amount of viscous cement; magnitude decreases as effective pressure increases. The frequency of the maximum imaginary part of the normal stiffness is determined mainly by cement viscosity and contact geometry. The tangential contact stiffness virtually is not influenced by the viscous fluid.

       " {u'abstract': [u'We analyze prestack PS migration images and their focusing sensitivity to errors in the computed PS traveltimes. The key analysis tool is a formula that defines PS traveltimes errors as explicit functions of velocity model errors. The most important factors in this formula are the PS velocity and the P-to-S velocity ratio. Analysis shows that the error in PS traveltime for shallow events is usually larger than that for deep events for a given error in the velocity model. Also the PS traveltime is affected more severely by errors in the PS-velocity model than in the P-to-S velocity ratio. The effect of traveltime errors increases with dip angle of reflectors. Numerical analysis shows that, for a fixed scatterpoint, the effect of the PS-wave velocity error is several times larger than the effect of the error in the P-to-S velocity ratio. Examples from field data show that the PS-wave velocity must be estimated accurately with errors less than 1% in order perfectly flatten the events in common-image-point (CIP) gathers. In contrast, an error in the PS-velocity ratio of up to several percent is allowed. This suggests that for acceptable PS-wave migration, only the PS-velocity model and a rough estimate of the P-to-S velocity ratio is needed. This finding is useful for processing PS-wave data because it is difficult and time consuming to estimate the velocity ratio accurately from the real data. This finding is also useful for our understanding of PS-wave behavior and for PS-wave imaging.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'Numerical anisotropy is one of the main problems in the design of explicit 3D depth-extrapolation operators. This paper introduces a new method based on constraining the number of independent coefficients for the full 3D extrapolation operator. The extrapolation operator is divided into two regions. The coefficients for the inner part of the extrapolation operator are treated the same as the full 3D extrapolation operator. The coefficients for the outer part of the extrapolation operator are constrained to be constant as a function of azimuth for a given radius. This strategy reduces the number of floating-point operations because, for each extrapolation step, the number of complex multiplications are reduced and replaced by complex additions. The numerical workload of this alternative scheme is comparable to the Hale-McClellan scheme. Impulse responses are compared with finite-difference solutions for the two-way acoustic-wave equation. It is demonstrated that the numerical anisotropy for the proposed scheme is negligible and that the constrained-depth-extrapolation operator can be used in media with large lateral velocity contrasts. The design of constrained-depth-extrapolation operators with different maximum propagation angles in inline and crossline directions is explained and exemplified. These types of operators can be used to suppress the propagation of aliased energy in the crossline direction during depth extrapolation while reducing numerical cost.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'We develop beamlet propagation and imaging using Gabor-Daubechies (G-D) frame decomposition based on local perturbation theory and apply it to target-oriented prestack depth migration. The method is formulated with local background velocities and local perturbations in wavefield extrapolation. The localized propagators and phase-correction operators are obtained analytically or semianalytically by one-way operator decomposition and screen approximation in the beamlet and space-beamlet mixed domain. Beamlet wavefields have superior localization properties in both local space and direction (wave-number) over Gaussian beams in the sense that localizations are not limited within short propagation distances in either homogeneous or heterogeneous media. Comparisons of the prestack depth-migrated images for the 2D SEG-EAGE salt model and the Marmousi model indicate that, for seismic-wave propagation and imaging in complex structural environments, the G-D beamlet propagator has higher accuracy and better wide-angle properties than do global propagators. Target-oriented prestack G-D beamlet migration is performed by means of local-angle-domain imaging and controlled superposition of common-dip-angle images based on the local directivity features of the target structures. This considers the spatial and direction localizations of beamlets. As a numerical example, we process the 2D SEG-EAGE salt-model prestack data. The results show that the proposed migration method has considerable advantages in suppressing noise and enhancing structural features. Image quality for subsalt structures, especially for steep faults, is improved through structure-based superposition of common-angle images. This demonstrates the potential and capability of beamlet migration in target-oriented seismic imaging.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'Prestack migration in the time and depth domains is the premier tool for seismic imaging of complex structures. Unfortunately, an undersampled acquisition geometry, a limited recording aperture, and strong velocity contrasts lead to uneven illumination of the subsurface. This results in blurring the migrated image, sometimes referred to as acquisition footprint noise in the migrated image. To remedy this blurring partially, we introduce prestack migration deconvolution (MD). The MD filter is a layered-medium approximation to the inverse Hessian matrix that is applied locally to the migrated section. Both synthetic- and field-data results show noticeable improvements in reducing migration artifacts and increasing lateral spatial resolution by more than 10%. The computational expense for constructing the MD filter is related to the MD operator length. Its cost is about the same as that for migration, but  opportunities exist for significantly reducing this cost. Results suggest that MD should be applied to migrated sections to optimize image quality.'],\n",

In previous models, ground coupling was mainly considered as a disk lying on top of a half-space, not considering the fact that in current practice geophones are spiked and are buried for optimal response. In this paper we introduce a new model that captures the spike added to the geophone and models the effect of geophone burial. The geophone is modeled as a rigid, movable cylinder embedded in a half-space near or at the surface. The coupling problem is then tackled by a scattering approach using the elastic form of reciprocity; we consider the vertical component only. The main feature in the coupling function is a resonance whose location and shape depend on the different parameters of the geophone and the soil. In accordance with previous models, adding mass reduces the frequency of resonance. However, we show that pure mass loading assumption is too restrictive for standard geophones. Our new model shows that increasing the spike radius and length decreases the frequency of resonance and the resonance is more peaked. Furthermore, burying the geophone decreases the frequency of resonance, but when one takes into account that the soil at depth is more compact, then the behavior is as observed in practice \\u2014 namely, an increase in frequency of resonance. As for the properties of the soil, the shear-wave velocity has the largest effect; when increased, it shifts the frequency of resonance to the high-frequency end as desired.'],\n",

The aim of our method is to capture the intrinsic properties of geologic structures and then to identify and hence understand the behavior of the observed magnetic-anomaly map. The magnetic-anomaly map is modeled using a 2D matrix. In the DMRF approach, each pixel of the matrix is evaluated considering neighboring pixels. In synthetic models, anomalies of magnetic dipoles are tested for different depths, orientation angles, and lengths. The DMRF method also is applied to the vertical magnetic-anomaly map of the Sivas-Divrigi region in Turkey, which contains the Dumluca iron ore reserves. Shallow reserves are detected clearly by the DMRF method, proving greater accuracy than classical filtering techniques.

       " {u'abstract': [u'Separating the fields produced by sources at different depths is a common requirement in the interpretation of potential field data. Approaches to this problem are generally data- or model-based. Data-based methods require clear linear segments in the logarithmic power spectrum of the data corresponding to different components of the field. Various types of filters can then be designed to carry out the separation. When the logarithmic power spectrum shows no identifiable linear spectral segments, other approaches are necessary. We outline a model-based method that does not depend on power-spectral information but requires independent estimates of the average depths of the source distributions, e.g., from seismic interpretations. An ensemble of models using fractal source distributions is computed based on these known values, and filter parameters are determined that produce the closest fit (in a least-squares sense) to the theoretical fields that each source distribution generates. This approach is used to separate basement effects from intrasedimentary sources in magnetic data collected over the Colville Hills, Northwest Territories, Canada. Seismic data interpretation places crystalline basement at \\u223c10 km depth and an intrasedimentary basaltic layer at \\u223c2 km.

First, we determine the behavior of the current on a realistic GPR antenna in a borehole through detailed FDTD modeling of the antenna and its immediate surroundings. To model transmission and reception, we then replicate this antenna current behavior on a much-coarser grid using a superposition of point-electric-dipole source and receiver responses.

Increased imaginary conductivity and phase were observed for samples from the smear zone (contaminated with residual-phase hydrocarbon), exceeding values obtained for samples contaminated with dissolved-phase hydrocarbons, and in turn, exceeding values obtained for uncontaminated samples. Real conductivity, although generally elevated for samples from the smear zone, did not show a strong correlation with contamination. Controlled experiments on uncontaminated samples from the field site indicate that variations in surface area, electrolytic conductivity, and water content across the site cannot account for the high imaginary conductivity observed within the smear zone. We suggest that microbial processes may be responsible for the enhanced IP response observed at contaminated locations. Scanning electron microscopy and IP measurements during acid leaching indicate that etched pits on mineral surfaces \\u2014 caused by the production of organic acids or formed during microbial colonization of these surfaces \\u2014 are not the cause of the IP enhancement.

       " {u'abstract': [u'Existing estimates of footprint size for airborne electromagnetic (AEM) systems have been based largely on the inductive limit of the response. We present calculations of frequency-domain, AEM-footprint sizes in infinite-horizontal, thin-sheet, and half-space models for the case of finite frequency and conductivity. In a half-space the original definition of the footprint is extended to be the side length of the cube with its top centered below the transmitter that contains the induced currents responsible for 90% of the secondary field measured at the receiver. For a horizontal, coplanar helicopter frequency-domain system, the in-phase footprint for induction numbers less than 0.4 (thin sheet) or less than 0.6 (half-space) increases from around 3.7 times the flight height at the inductive limit to more than 10 times the flight height. For a vertical-coaxial system the half-space footprint exceeds nine times the flight height for induction numbers less than 0.09. For all models, geometries, and frequencies, the quadrature footprint is approximately half to two-thirds that of the in-phase footprint. These footprint estimates are supported by 3D model calculations that suggest resistive targets must be separated by the footprint dimension for their individual anomalies to be resolved completely. Analysis of frequency-domain AEM field data acquired for antarctic sea-ice thickness measurements supports the existence of a smaller footprint for the quadrature component in comparison with the in-phase, but the effect is relatively weak. In-phase and quadrature footprints estimated by comparing AEM to drillhole data are considerably smaller than footprints from 1D and 3D calculations. However, we consider the footprints estimated directly from field data unreliable since they are based on a drillhole data set that did not adequately define the true, 3D, sea-ice thickness distribution around the AEM flight line.'],\n",

In recent years, a desire for faster and more cost-efficient methods has led to growing interest in the possibility of using airborne systems, and in 2001 a number of test flights were performed using a frequency-domain, helicopter-borne electromagnetic (HEM) system. We perform a theoretical examination of the resolution capabilities of the applied system. Quantitative model parameter analyses show that the system only weakly resolves conductive, near-surface layers but can resolve layer boundary to a depth of more than 100 m. Modeling experiments also show that the effect of altimeter errors on the inversion results is serious. We suggest a new interpretation scheme for HEM data founded solely on full nonlinear 1D inversion and providing layered-earth models supported by data misfit parameters and a quantitative model-parameter analysis. The backbone of the scheme is the removal of cultural coupling effects followed by a multilayer inversion that in turn provides reliable starting models for a subsequent few-layer inversion. A new procedure for correlation in the model space ensures model sections with slow lateral variations in resistivity, normally assumed in sedimentary environments.

       " {u'abstract': [u'Fixed-wing towed-bird airborne electromagnetic (AEM) systems are asymmetric because the receiver flies behind and below the transmitter. As a consequence, the measured response is quite different when the aircraft flies a traverse line in the reverse direction, even when the causative bodies are symmetric. Because fixed-wing AEM survey traverses are parallel and are flown in alternating directions, the response of bodies can change markedly from one line to the next. This means that images of the measured data are complicated and difficult to interpret. In a survey in Quebec, Canada, each traverse line was flown twice, once in the normal direction and once in the reverse directions. These data were combined to give a response measured by a symmetric system termed the virtual symmetric array (VSA). The VSA response can enhance the S/N ratio, and the response will be symmetric if the con ductive targets are symmetric. Hence, any response asymmetry is indicative of asymmetry in the ground. This means that dip direction can be inferred from the VSA response. Images of VSA data show similar properties, making them a very useful tool for interpreting fixed-wing EM data. A field example is used to illustrate that the standard presentations (filtered images and energy envelope images) are smeared and blocky, whereas the VSA images show sharper resolution, better trending, and better subtle structural features on maps. In most cases, data are not collected in reverse-line directions, but it is possible to create an interpolated VSA image using the reverse line direction data from adjacent lines. When this process is applied to field data, the resulting images have all of the advantage of VSA images, except for somewhat lower S/N ratio improvements. Also, short strike-length features are elongated, and sudden changes in amplitude are not well imaged.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u\"The use of marine controlled-source electromagnetic EM (CSEM) sounding to detect thin resistive layers at depths below the seafloor has been exploited recently to assess the resistivity of potential hydrocarbon reservoirs before drilling. We examine the sensitivity of the CSEM method to such layers with forward and inverse modeling in one and three dimensions. The 3D modeling demonstrates that if both source and receivers are over a tabular 3D target, 1D modeling predicts the observed response to very high accuracy. Experimental design can thus be based on 1D analysis in which hundreds of range and frequency combinations can be computed to find the optimal survey parameters for a given target structure. Modeling in three dimensions shows that the vertical electric-field response is largest over the edges of a 3D target. The 3D modeling also suggests that a target body needs to have a diameter twice the burial depth to be reliably seen by CSEM sounding. A simple air-wave model (energy propagating from source to receiver via the atmosphere) allows the effects of the target layer and atmosphere to be separated and shows where sensitivity to the target is diminished or lost because of finite water depth as a function of range, frequency, and seafloor resistivity. Unlike DC resistivity sounding, the marine CSEM method is not completely T-equivalent and, in principle, can resolve resistivity and thickness separately. Smooth inversion provides an estimate of the method's resolving power and highlights the fact that although the radial CSEM fields contain most of the sensitivity to the thin resistive target, inverted alone they produce only increasing resistivity with depth. Inclusion of the radial mode CSEM data forces the recovery of the thin resistor, but magnetotelluric data can be used more effectively to achieve the same result.\"],\n",

In particular, we define a dimensionless response parameter \\u03b1, derived from frequency-domain data, that is numerically identical to the historic wire-loop response parameter, and is closely related to the thin-sheet and half-space response parameters. The arctangent of \\u03b1 is the phase \\u03d5 of the secondary field. We further define a dimensionless amplitude response parameter \\u03b2, calculated as the ratio between inductive limits estimated from the data and from system geometry. The inductive limit calculated from geometry provides an initial altitude correction to the data amplitudes. Additional data corrections further correct phase effects and altimeter variations. The amplitude and phase errors in calibration become independent differences between the data and the fitted model in the \\u03d5\\u03b2 domain. This investigation was undertaken in the response-parameter domain rather than in the data domain, allowing the analysis to be independent of absolute values of conductivity and system frequencies. Statistical analysis in the \\u03d5\\u03b2 domain of recently acquired data suggests that amplitude calibration errors in HEM data may cause fitted models to have systematic depth errors of 1 to 2 m for near-surface conductors; variable altitude measurement errors are about 1.5 m over seawater.'],\n",

The porous sand model is constructed from spherical particles whose size distribution mimics well-sorted unconsolidated sands. The geometry of the model is obtained by simulating critical processes in sedimentary rock formations. Hysteretic behavior and relations between the sample bulk modulus, strain, and stress are obtained. The simulated sample reproduces experimental transient and stationary loading-unloading behavior. We find good correspondence of pressure and strain dependence of elastic moduli in our model with semilinear elasticity theory predictions.

Also, to reduce acquisition costs, various methods are used to record and then separate data from different source locations using vibrators sweeping simultaneously, but these methods suffer from poor data separation and harmonic contamination. A novel combination of heritage Mobil High Fidelity Vibratory Seismic (HFVS) and heritage Exxon vibrator technologies solves these problems with vibroseis data. The method involves vibrator separation combined with vibrator signature deconvolution in such a manner that the output is minimum phase and matches impulsive data. Vibrator signatures are calculated from the vibrator accelerometer measurements. The signatures from multiple vibrators and multiple sweeps are used to design a filter that optimally separates the data from each vibrator and replaces the signatures with a specially designed impulse response. Specific procedures are included to reduce the effects of inversion noise, which can distort the phase. HFVS recording can be used to increase production rates and reduce acquisition costs or to increase spatial sampling and improve data quality. Data recorded from multiple vibrators sweeping simultaneously can be separated by at least 60 dB. After separation, the data from each vibrator can be processed as unique source points. Compared with traditional vibrator arrays, individually processing each source point can result in better data quality by reducing intra-array effects and improving the mitigation of ground-roll noise.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'We have developed a simple but practical methodology for updating subsalt velocities using wave-equation, migration-perturbation scans. For the sake of economy and scalability (with respect to full source-receiver migration) and accuracy (with respect to common-azimuth migration), we use shot-profile, wave-equation migration. As input for subsalt-velocity analysis, we provide wave-equation migration scans with velocity scanning limited to the subsalt sediments. Throughout the migration-scan sections, we look for the best focusing or structural positioning of characteristic seismic events. The picking on the migration stacks selects the value of the best perturbation attribute (alpha-scaling factor) along with the corresponding position and local dip for the chosen seismic events. The associated, locally coherent events are then demigrated to the base of the salt horizon. Our key observation is that this process is theoretically equivalent to performing a datuming to a base of salt followed by subsalt migration of the redatumed data perturbed-velocity profiles. Thanks to this implicit redatuming of shot profiles, no ray tracing through the salt body is required. Thus, the events picked on the subsalt-velocity scans only need to be demigrated to the base of salt. For the event demigration we use 3D specular-ray tracing up to the base of the salt horizon within a predefined range of reflection angles. Event demigration produces model-independent data \\u2014 time and time slope \\u2014 that are then kinematically migrated using the current tomographic-inversion working model.

       " {u'abstract': [u'We consider multiple transmitted, reflected, and converted qP-qSV-waves or multiple transmitted and reflected SH-waves in a horizontally layered medium that is transversely isotropic with a vertical symmetry axis (VTI). Traveltime and offset (horizontal distance) between a source and receiver, not necessarily in the same layer, are expressed as functions of horizontal slowness. These functions are given in terms of a Taylor series in slowness in exactly the same form as for a layered isotropic medium. The coefficients depend on the parameters of the anisotropic layers through which the wave has passed, and there is no weak anisotropy assumption. Using classical formulas, the traveltime or traveltime squared can then be expressed as a Taylor series in even powers of offset. These Taylor series give rise to a shifted hyperbola traveltime approximation and a new continued-fraction approximation, described by four parameters that match the Taylor series up to the sixth power in offset. Further approximations give several simplified continued-fraction approximations, all of which depend on three parameters: zero-offset traveltime, NMO velocity, and a heterogeneity coefficient. The approximations break down when there is a cusp in the group velocity for the qSV-wave. Numerical studies indicate that approximations of traveltime squared are generally better than those for traveltime. A new continued-fraction approximation that depends on three parameters is more accurate than the commonly used continued-fraction approximation and the shifted hyperbola.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'The cancellation of harmonic noise from geophysical records can be achieved by subtracting an estimate of the harmonic noise. Estimating the harmonic noise consists of estimating the fundamental frequency and the amplitudes and phases of all harmonics. We propose a new frequency-estimation method that builds upon the estimator originally proposed by Nyman and Gaiser. This Nyman and Gaiser estimation (NGE) method exploits the fact that the noise fundamental frequency is known to be close to 60 Hz. The NGE method is based on solving a system of four equations that determine the amplitude, phase, and frequency of a given harmonic in the harmonic noise. Hence, NGE can produce frequency estimates for all harmonics. Our improved estimator uses a suitable linear combination of these NGE frequency estimates to produce a more accurate estimate of the fundamental frequency. Our method is more accurate than NGE, and its accuracy is comparable to least-squares estimation (LSE). The advantage of our method is that it is about two times faster than LSE. This speed gain can become valuable when processing large magnetotelluric (MT) data records. Applying our method to the restoration of MT data, we found that the harmonic noise amplitude in the periodogram is reduced by at least 60 dB to a level below that of MT data.'],\n",

The computational procedure is based on kinematic properties of the data and uses Fermat's principle to define the multiples.

Their direction cosines are specified from the receiver and the source, related respectively to the traveltime gradients of the common-source and common-receiver gathers. Based on the geometry of an inverse ray through the lowest layer, the velocity near the reflection point is derived from either an exact solution or a transcendental equation. For the transcendental equation, the velocity bounds and the imaging stability depend on the interface dips, and the incident angles upon the interface above the reflection point. The velocity imaging is stable or quasi-stable when the reflection point is located between the intersections of the inverse rays and the upper interface. Application of the technique to a discontinuous normal fault and a forearc basin show that most of the velocity imaging is stable. However, if the inverse reflected rays pass through steep interfaces, the fault plane or highly inhomogeneous media, the imaging is usually unstable because multivalued and incorrect velocities are generated. I conclude that the method is fast and capable of imaging seismic sections with poor quality when compared with prestack depth migration and reflection tomography.'],\n",

Because of the asymmetrical paths of converted waves, even for horizontally layered media, the calculation of a conversion point for converted waves is complicated. Previous authors have obtained analytic solutions for the conversion point for converted waves in a horizontally layered media. We extend those results to the more general case of converted waves from a dipping reflector with a homogeneous, isotropic overburden. By using Snell's law, we derive a quartic equation and solve it uniquely for the conversion point. The resultant analytic expression is a function of offset, compressional-, and shear-wave velocities; normal reflector depth; and dip angle at the conversion point. This solution can be readily used to generate accurate synthetic seismic responses for converted waves based on ray theory. It also can be extended to operators for stacking converted waves and applying DMO correction.\"],\n",

Specifically, prestack Kirchhoff time migration for transversely isotropic media with a vertical symmetry axis (VTI media) is implemented using an analytical offset-midpoint traveltime equation that represents the equivalent of Cheop's pyramid for VTI media. It includes higher-order terms necessary to better handle anisotropy as well as vertical inhomogeneity. Application of this enhanced Kirchhoff time-migration method to the anisotropic Marmousi data set demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach. Further application of the method to field data from Trinidad results in sharper reflectivity images of the subsurface, with the faults better focused and positioned than with images obtained using isotropic methods.

As far as prestack time demigration is concerned, we present closed-form expressions for mapping in homogeneous isotropic media, while for homogeneous VTI media we present a system of four nonlinear equations with four unknowns to solve numerically. The expressions for prestack map time migration in VTI homogeneous media are directly applicable to the problem of anisotropic parameter estimation (i.e., the anellipticity parameter \\u03b7) in the context of time-migration velocity analysis. In addition, we present closed-form expressions for both prestack map time migration and demigration in the common-offset domain for pure-mode (P-P or S-S) waves in homogeneous isotropic media that use only the slope in the common-offset domain as opposed to slopes in both the common-shot and common-receiver (or equivalently the common-offset and common-midpoint) domains. All time-migration and demigration equations presented can be used in media with mild lateral and vertical velocity variations, provided the velocity is replaced with the local rms velocity. Finally, we discuss the condition for applicability of prestack map depth migration and demigration in heterogeneous anisotropic media that allows the formation of caustics and explain that this condition is satisfied if, given a velocity model and acquisition geometry, one can map-depth-migrate without ambiguity in either the migrated location or the migrated orientation of reflectors in the image.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'We present the theory of crosscorrelogram migration of ghost reflections, also known as interferometric imaging, to delineate reflector geometries from inverse vertical seismic profile data. The theory includes the equations for forward modeling, migration, asymptotic inversion, and model resolution of crosscorrelgrams. Rather than using primary reflections, crosscorrelogram migration can use ghost reflections to reconstruct the reflector geometry. Other multiples can be used as well, including pegleg multiples and higher-order multiples. Its main advantages over conventional Kirchhoff migration are (1) both source location (e.g., drill-bit position) and source wavelet need not be known (such as when using a drill bit as a source in a deviated well), (2) it is insensitive to source-related static errors, and (3) it has wider subsurface illumination than conventional Kirchhoff migration of primary reflections. Crosscorrelation migration can effectively widen the source-receiver aperture by more than 50% compared to standard inverse vertical seismic profile (IVSP) migration. The primary disadvantages are (1) it uses ghost reflections for imaging, which can be weaker (or sometimes more distorted) than primary reflections; (2) crosscorrelation creates virtual multiples that can sometimes appear as coherent noise in the final image; and (3) it has poorer horizontal resolution than standard IVSP migration. Results from imaging simulated IVSP traces show that crosscorrelation migration produces reflectivity-like images that correlate well with the actual reflector geometry of a layered fault model. These images are almost completely immune to static errors at the source location and have wider subsurface illumination than conventional IVSP migration images. We also apply crosscorrelation migration to IVSP data recorded at a Friendswood, Texas, test site. Results show that the crosscorrelation image correlates better with the well log and wider subsurface illumination than a conventional Kirchhoff migration image.'],\n",

Arrays were formed by extracting sets of traces from the main data set and stacking them to produce individual traces of a receiver gather. We calculated semblance of each receiver gather to evaluate array performance. High values of semblance indicate that an array effectively removes surface waves while preserving reflections.

This condition reduces the size of a digital sample to just a few grains across. Also, small physical fragments of rock, such as cuttings, may be the only material available to produce digital images. Will the results be meaningful for a larger rock volume? To address this question, we use a number of natural and artificial medium- to high-porosity, well-sorted sandstones. The 3D microtomography volumes are obtained from each physical sample. Then, analogous to making thin sections of drill cuttings, we select a large number of small 2D slices from a 3D scan. As a result, a single physical sample produces hundreds of 2D virtual-drill-cuttings images. Corresponding 3D pore-space realizations are generated statistically from these 2D images; fluid flow is simulated in three dimensions, and the absolute permeability is computed. The results show that small fragments of medium\\u2013 to high-porosity sandstones that are statistically subrepresentative of a larger sample will not yield the exact porosity and permeability of the sample.

The ratio of rock permeability to fluid viscosity defines mobility, which largely controls pore-fluid motion and pore pressure in a porous medium. High fluid mobility permits pore-pressure equilibrium either between pores or between heterogeneous regions, resulting in a low-frequency domain where Gassmann's equations are valid. In contrast, low fluid mobility can produce strong dispersion, even within the seismic band. Here, the low-frequency assumption fails. Since most rocks in the general sedimentary section have very low permeability and fluid mobility (shales, siltstones, tight limestones, etc.), most rocks are not in the low-frequency domain, even at seismic frequencies. Only those rocks with high permeability (porous sands and carbonates) will remain in the low-frequency domain in the seismic or sonic band.\"],\n",

The technique incorporates a moving differential median filter to minimize line-level errors, to level survey-line data, and to microlevel data with no tie-line control. This overcomes the problem of standard leveling methods that lose their effectiveness with irregular flight patterns. To validate the method, we use it to level very-low-frequency (VLF) electromagnetic (EM) data from a helicopter survey where flight lines are parallel. Leveling is also performed on a set of vintage aeromagnetic data from the North Sea, gathered from nonparallel flight lines. Results show that the differential median filter leveling technique is superior to the standard leveling method because it results in fewer line errors and less distortion of high-wavenumber anomalies when processing irregular survey lines, making the method suitable for a wide variety of data sets.'],\n",

The dispersion characteristics depend on the permittivity and thickness of the effective surface waveguide and the permittivity of the material below it. We introduce a scheme for estimating the values of these parameters from dispersed transverse-electric (TE) and transverse-magnetic (TM) GPR data that is analogous to recently developed methods for analyzing dispersed Rayleigh waves recorded on multichannel seismic data. Our scheme involves calculating phase-velocity spectra, picking dispersion curves from the spectra, and then inverting the dispersion curves for the subsurface material properties by using a combined local- and global-minimization procedure. Application of this new scheme to synthetic and field data demonstrates its efficacy in providing the required physical property information. Where the surface layer is relatively distinct and uniform, inversions of the resulting high-quality dispersed TE data provide all required parameters. In more heterogeneous environments, joint inversions of the TE and TM data, which usually include information in different frequency ranges, may be required.'],\n",

We present an improved GPR tomography technique based on a combination of seismic tomographic methods and a finite-difference solution of the eikonal equation. Our inversion algorithm uses velocity gradient zones and bending rays that represent realistic geology in the subsurface. We tested the technique on theoretical and experimental models with anomalous bodies of varying saturations and velocity and applied it to data from a GPR field experiment that analyzed the root zones of trees. Synthetic results showed that the resolution of our technique is better than that of published methods, especially for local anomalies with sharp velocity contacts. Our laboratory experiments consisted of four objects buried in sand with various water saturations. The GPR tomogram could map the objects and determine their degree of saturation. The velocities are compatible with those of the complex refraction index method; their relationship to the water content fits a previously published empirical equation. Our original field experiment around a poplar tree could map the heterogeneous subsurface and distinguish a central low velocity beneath the tree from the peripheral negative anomaly of a refill.

When measured on a horizontal plane, these components generate, in the spectral domain, six power spectral densities (PSDs) and fifteen cross-spectra. The cross-spectra can be split into two groups: a real group and a pure imaginary group. If the source distribution is statistically stationary, 1D spectra can be found from the 2D spectra via the slice theorem. The PSDs form two power-sum rules that link all gradient components. The power-sum rules, in combination with further equalities between the power and cross-spectra, reduce the number of independent spectra to 13, a number reduced to seven if the power spectrum of the potential is assumed isotropic. The power-sum rules, cross-spectral phases, and coherence between components all provide information on the internal consistency of a set of gradiometry measurements. This information can be used to assess the noise, to determine the isotropy, and, for a self-similar source, to calculate the scaling factor and average depth. When applied to a data set collected in the North Sea, the power-sum rules reveal high-frequency noise that is distributed among only three of the gradient components; additionally, the coherences reveal the source to be anisotropic with a nonzero correlation length.\"],\n",

To obtain the desired expression, we consistently linearize all quantities in small stiffness perturbations from a given isotropic solid. Our result incorporates all known weak-anisotropy approximations of the quartic moveout coefficient and extends them further to triclinic media. By comparing our approximation with nonhyperbolic moveout obtained from the ray-traced reflection traveltimes, we find that the former predicts azimuthal variations of the quartic moveout when its magnitude is less than 20% of the corresponding hyperbolic moveout term. We also study the influence of reflector curvature on nonhyperbolic moveout. It turns out that the curvature produces no quartic moveout in the reflector strike direction, where the anisotropy-induced moveout nonhyperbolicity is usually nonnegligible.

Because of the high contrast in electrical conductivity between the salt and surrounding sediments, Gemini is an attractive target for electromagnetic interrogation. Using a broadband magnetotelluric (MT) sensor package developed at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, data in the period band of 1 to 3000 s were collected at 42 sites in a series of profiles over Gemini, one of which was directly over a linear ridgelike salt feature striking roughly northwest\\u2013southeast and another orthogonal to it.

       " {u'abstract': [u'This article contains the findings of geophysical investigations conducted at the site of the proposed international airport at Melville Hall, Commonwealth of Dominica, West Indies. The main geophysical method used was seismic refraction; additionally, ground-penetrating radar, resistivity sounding, and resistivity tomographic imaging were performed at some of the sites, but only the results of the seismic refraction and electrical resistivity sounding contributed to the development of the model presented. Analysis of the seismic data shows a gradual increase in velocity with depth, for which a model has been determined. Ancillary models or predictions of porosity, density, and natural compaction with depth are given, based on the basic seismic model. The seismic velocity model allows an engineer with a topographic map of the area to predict the volume of rock/soil in each rippability class and to project the rate of ripping. The results of the 1D resistivity soundings strongly suggest a nearly homogeneous material with resistivity variations that can be explained by moisture and low-level lithological variations. Therefore, based on integrated seismic and resistivity results, our model is a thick ash/boulder conglomerate with velocity increasing with depth, mainly from overburden stress compaction. In other words, the material at depth is not well-cemented rock. As the overburden stress is removed, the material essentially expands and loosens to produce a lower seismic velocity, similar to present surface conditions. The soil/rock can therefore be removed with little or no ripping or blasting.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'If the aperture of a seismic reflection experiment is strongly limited, Kirchhoff migration suffers from strong artifacts attributable to incomplete summation. This can be overcome by restricting the migration operator to the region that physically contributes to a reflection event. Examples of such limited-aperture experiments include data acquisition in boreholes, tunnels, and mines. We present an extension to three-component (3C) Kirchhoff prestack depth migration, where the migration operator is restricted to the Fresnel volume of the specular reflected raypath. We use the measured polarization direction at a 3C receiver to determine points of specular reflection. In homogeneous media, the polarization angle of 3C data can be used directly to decide whether a certain image point belongs to the Fresnel volume of a specular reflection. In heterogeneous media, the Fresnel volume around an image point is approximated by means of paraxial ray tracing. The method is tested on a synthetic vertical seismic profiling experiment with strongly limited aperture. Migration artifacts and crosstalk effects from converted waves are strongly reduced compared with standard migration schemes. The method is successfully applied to seismic data acquired in a tunnel.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u' Seismic depth migration back-propagates seismic data in the correct depth position using information about the velocity of the medium. Usually, Kirchhoff summation is the preferred migration procedure for seismic-while-drilling (SWD) data because it can handle virtually any configuration of sources and receivers and one can compensate for irregular spatial sampling of the array elements (receivers and sources). Under the assumption of a depth-varying velocity model, with receivers arranged along a horizontal circumference and sources placed along the central vertical axis, we reformulate the Kirchhoff summation in the angular frequency domain. In this way, the migration procedure becomes very efficient because the migrated volume is obtained by an inverse Fourier transform of the weighted data. The algorithm is suitable for 3D SWD acquisitions when the aforementioned hypothesis holds. We show migration tests on SWD synthetic data, and we derive solutions to reduce the migration artifacts and to control aliasing. The procedure is also applied on a real 3D SWD data set. The result compares satisfactorily with the seismic stack section obtained from surface reflection data and with the results from traditional Kirchhoff migration.'],\n",

Conventional velocity analysis is a tool that may form the basis for obtaining interval velocities for this purpose. However, velocity analysis is inaccurate, and in this paper we focus on the possibilities and limitations of using velocity analysis for pore-pressure prediction. A time-lapse seismic data set from a segment that has undergone a pore-pressure increase of 5 to 7 MPa between the two surveys is analyzed for velocity changes using detailed velocity analysis. A synthetic time-lapse survey is used to test the sensitivity of the velocity analysis with respect to noise. The analysis shows that the pore-pressure increase cannot be detected by conventional velocity analysis because the uncertainty is much greater than the expected velocity change for a reservoir of the given thickness and burial depth. Finally, by applying amplitude-variation-with-offset (AVO) analysis to the same data, we demonstrate that seismic amplitude analysis may yield more precise information about velocity changes than velocity analysis.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'This paper presents a new approach to borehole resistivity and acoustic imaging data compression. The method is based on the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) combined with the set partitioning in the hierarchical trees (SPIHT) coding method. The primary advantages of the DWT + SPIHT method are its superior compression performance, simple implementation, and constant compression and transmission rate control. This new approach generally performs better than the traditional discrete cosine transform (DCT) followed by Huffman coding methods such as JPEG, particularly for target compression ratios greater than 50:1. Image block size plays a key role in using this method. To achieve the best compression performance, the image block size needs to be selected appropriately. In general, large image block sizes and more DWT decomposition levels result in higher compression ratios and/or fewer reconstruction errors. Whenever possible, image block sizes that allow the maximum levels of dyadic DWT decomposition should be used. When insufficient data samples are available in either depth or azimuthal direction, a small number of extra data samples can be added without sacrificing the overall compression performance. The DWT + SPIHT method also shows good fidelity in representing major features in borehole images such as fractures and sinusoids.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'The depth of investigation in electromagnetic (EM) soundings is a maximum depth at which a given target in a given host can be detected by a given sensor. It is of primary interest in EM exploration, particularly for small EM sensors having negligible separation between the transmitter and receiver coils. The depth of investigation is related to many factors, such as sensor sensitivity, precision, operating frequencies, ambient noise level, target and host properties, and the techniques used in data processing and interpretation. Quantitative understanding of the relationships between the depth of investigation and these factors will help users meet their geologic objectives, avoid unnecessary survey expenses, and display meaningful geologic features. Simple equations to estimate the depth of investigation for handheld EM sensors have been derived from analyzing the EM response based on layered half-space models. The results show that the depth of investigation is approximately proportional to the square root of the skin depth in the host for a given detection threshold and conductivity contrast between the target and host. For a given skin depth, the depth of investigation increases with the target conductivity and conductivity contrast and decreases with the detection threshold. Choosing a threshold mainly depends on the S/N ratio of the EM data if the sensor setup, data acquisition methods, and processing techniques are well established. A high threshold such as 20% or 30% is recommended for resistive targets or in areas where environmental noise is high or where terrain conductivity is low (<50 mS/m). In contrast, a threshold as low as 5% or 10% can be used for conductive targets in quiet areas. Field examples are presented to illustrate how to use the depth of investigation in data interpretation and presentation.'],\n",

The estimated qPqP traveltime parameters are P-wave normal-incidence traveltime, P-wave NMO velocity, and a heterogeneity factor entering in the shifted hyperbolic traveltime approximation or in a continued fraction traveltime approximation. The estimated qPqSV traveltime parameters are PS normal-incidence traveltime and PS NMO velocity combined with the qPqP traveltime parameters. These are used to compute S-wave normal-incidence traveltime and SV-wave NMO velocity. The estimated traveltime parameters are entered into explicit expressions for the four layer parameters and the thickness of each layer. These layer-recursive formulas, except for slightly different initial conditions, are also valid for ocean-bottom seismic data. For reflected SH-wave traveltimes, there are two elastic parameters and thicknesses per layer, and we can estimate three traveltime parameters. However, two of these traveltime parameters are functionally related, and it is impossible to estimate the three layer parameters from SH-wave traveltimes only.'],\n",

To characterize the mining-altered hydrology of this watershed, an airborne reconnaissance was conducted in 2002 using airborne thermal infrared imagery (TIR) and helicopter-mounted electromagnetic (HEM) surveys. TIR uses the temperature differential between surface water and groundwater to locate areas where groundwater emerges at the surface. TIR anomalies located in the survey included seeps and springs, as well as mine discharges. In a follow-up ground investigation, hand-held GPS units were used to locate 103 of the TIR anomalies. Of the sites investigated, 26 correlated with known mine discharges, whereas 27 were previously unknown. Seven known mine discharges previously obscured from TIR imagery were documented. HEM surveys were used to delineate the groundwater table and also to locate mine pools, mine discharges, and groundwater recharge zones. These surveys located 12 source regions and flow paths for acidic, metal-containing (conductive) mine drainage; areas containing acid-generating mine spoil; and areas of groundwater recharge and discharge, as well as identifying potential mine discharges previously obscured from TIR imagery by nondeciduous vegetation. Follow-up ground-based electromagnetic surveys verified the results of the HEM survey.

The location of the interpreted IP target correlated well with interpretations from an earlier IP/resistivity dipole-dipole survey. The imaginary component of the ratio of electric field measured along the profile normalized by the electric field at a reference site becomes nonzero over the position of an IP target. The complex ratio of the profiling dipole electric field and fixed-reference-dipole electric field, plotted as a function of frequency and dipole location, is a simple and robust procedure for recovering the IP effect. The NFIP method eliminates the expense and energy requirements of deploying large transmitters and is sensitive to deeper structures (structures that are difficult to resolve using traditional methods).

This method was applied to line drawings of the seismic profiles, providing the basis for delineation of the orebody in three dimensions. Synthetic seismic sections computed using the inferred bounding surfaces of the ore deposit are in reasonable agreement with observed reflections, even for along-strike lines not used to build the model. The ability to verify interpreted reflections using line intersections was critical to the development of our model.

Combination of the obtained depth-converted velocity map with electrical resistivity in-situ measurements enables us to estimate both water content and water conductivity. These quantities are essential to delineate infiltration of contaminants from the surface after industrial or agricultural activities.

This paper attempts to enhance this understanding by establishing the relationship between 2D and 3D inverse scattering free-surface multiple attenuation. A 3D model consisting of three scattering points (one scattered point located in the vertical plane containing the shooting line and the other two points outside this plane) in a homogeneous medium (for which the exact pressure field is analytically known) is used to show that the 2D inverse scattering multiple-attenuation algorithm predicts all free-surface multiples as does its 3D counterpart but with some traveltime and amplitude errors. One implication of this result is that the current 2D inverse scattering multiple-attenuation algorithm, with an appropriate 2D-to-3D correction, can be used to predict the free-surface multiples for data containing out-of-plane scattering.'],\n",

To this end, we introduce a powerful new tool: the depth-resolution plot (DRP). The DRP allows a theoretical study of how much the depth resolution in a potential-field inversion is influenced by the way the problem is discretized and regularized. The DRP also allows a careful study of the influence of various kinds of ambiguities, such as those from data errors or of a purely algebraic nature. The achievable depth resolution is related to the given discretization, regularization, and data noise level. We compute DRP by means of singular-value decomposition (SVD) or its generalization (GSVD), depending on the particular regularization method chosen. To illustrate the use of the DRP, we assume a source volume of specified depth and horizontal extent in which the solution is piecewise constant within a 3D grid of blocks. We consider various linear regularization terms in a Tikhonov (damped least-squares) formulation, some based on using higher-order derivatives in the objective function. DRPs are illustrated for both synthetic and real data. Our analysis shows that if the algebraic ambiguity is not too large and a suitable smoothing norm is used, some depth resolution can be obtained without resorting to any subjective choice of depth weighting.'],\n",

Despite being eclipsed by seismology, it has continued to be an important and sometimes crucial constraint in a number of exploration areas. In oil exploration the gravity method is particularly applicable in salt provinces, overthrust and foothills belts, underexplored basins, and targets of interest that underlie high-velocity zones. The gravity method is used frequently in mining applications to map subsurface geology and to directly calculate ore reserves for some massive sulfide orebodies. There is also a modest increase in the use of gravity techniques in specialized investigations for shallow targets. Gravimeters have undergone continuous improvement during the past 25 years, particularly in their ability to function in a dynamic environment. This and the advent of global positioning systems (GPS) have led to a marked improvement in the quality of marine gravity and have transformed airborne gravity from a regional technique to a prospect-level exploration tool that is particularly applicable in remote areas or transition zones that are otherwise inaccessible. Recently, moving-platform gravity gradiometers have become available and promise to play an important role in future exploration. Data reduction, filtering, and visualization, together with low-cost, powerful personal computers and color graphics, have transformed the interpretation of gravity data. The state of the art is illustrated with three case histories: 3D modeling of gravity data to map aquifers in the Albuquerque Basin, the use of marine gravity gradiometry combined with 3D seismic data to map salt keels in the Gulf of Mexico, and the use of airborne gravity gradiometry in exploration for kimberlites in Canada.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u\"The idea that the propagation of elastic waves can be anisotropic, i.e., that the velocity may depend on the direction, is about 175 years old. The first steps are connected with the top scientists of that time, people such as Cauchy, Fresnel, Green, and Kelvin. For most of the 19th century, anisotropic wave propagation was studied mainly by mathematical physicists, and the only applications were in crystal optics and crystal elasticity. During these years, important steps in the formal description of the subject were made. At the turn of the 20th century, Rudzki stressed the significance of seismic anisotropy. He studied many of its aspects, but his ideas were not applied. Research in seismic anisotropy became stagnant after his death in 1916. Beginning about 1950, the significance of seismic anisotropy for exploration seismics was studied, mainly in connection with thinly layered media and the resulting transverse isotropy. Very soon it became clear that the effect of layer-induced anisotropy on data acquired with the techniques of that time was negligible, so for the next few decades the subject was studied only by a handful of researchers. In the last two decades of the 20th century, anisotropy changed from a nuisance to a valuable asset. Gupta and especially Crampin pointed out that cracks in a rock mass lead to observable effects from which, in principle, the orientation and density of the cracks could be deduced. Since this information has direct significance for the reservoir properties of the rock, the interest in seismic anisotropy increased considerably. Improvements in acquisition technology, with well-designed approximations that made the complicated theory manageable and with efficient algorithms running on more powerful computers, have turned the theoretical ideas of the early times into an important exploration and production tool. Although seismic anisotropy is usually weak, it nevertheless has important consequences in our modern data. Thus, today anisotropy is an important issue in exploration and reservoir geophysics, and it belongs in every exploration geophysicist's toolkit.\"],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'Geophysical data are frequently collected with a fine sample interval along traverse lines but with a coarser sampling in the direction perpendicular to the traverses. This disparity in sampling intervals is particularly evident when magnetic data are collected simultaneously with airborne electromagnetic data. Interpolating this traverse data onto an evenly spaced 2D grid can result in aliasing artifacts. For example, narrow linear structures that trend at acute angles to the traverse lines are imaged as a thick/thin/thick feature, looking like a boudinage or string of beads. Applying the anisotropic diffusion process to the resulting grids of data removes the artifacts, but the grid values close to the traverses are altered significantly from their initial values. The altered values are therefore not faithful to the original traverse data. The anisotropic diffusion algorithm can be modified to constrain values close to the original traverses. This modification removes the aliasing artifacts and produces a data grid faithful to the original traverse data. Some small artifacts along the traverse lines in the final data grid become more evident when grids containing derivative data (such as the analytic signal) are generated from the new data grid. However, these small traverse-line artifacts can be removed with standard microleveling procedures. The constrained anisotropic diffusion process is iterative, and some experimentation is required to determine the appropriate number of iterations. '],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'We present a method of reflection tomography for anisotropic elastic parameters from PP and PS reflection seismic data. The method is based upon the differential semblance misfit functional in scattering angle and azimuth (DSA) acting on common-image-point gathers (CIGs) to find fitting velocity models. The CIGs are amplitude corrected using a generalized Radon transform applied to the data. Depth consistency between the PP and PS images is enforced by penalizing any mis-tie between imaged key reflectors. The mis-tie is evaluated by means of map migration-demigration applied to the geometric information (times and slopes) contained in the data. In our implementation, we simplify the codepthing approach to zero-scattering-angle data only. The resulting measure is incorporated as a regularization in the DSA misfit functional. We then resort to an optimization procedure, restricting ourselves to transversely isotropic (TI) velocity models. In principle, depending on the available surface-offset range and orientation of reflectors in the subsurface, by combining the DSA with codepthing, the anisotropic parameters for TI models can be determined, provided the orientation of the symmetry axis is known. A proposed strategy is applied to an ocean-bottom-seismic field data set from the North Sea.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'This paper presents a numerical technique for modeling elastic-wave propagation in media with discrete distributions of fractures. The scheme is developed following the explicit treatments of fractures based on a linear-slip displacement-discontinuity model instead of using an effective-medium theory. The algorithm is implemented on an irregular numerical mesh by using the proposed integral forms of the elastic-momentum equations and displacement-discontinuity conditions together with a triangular-grid finite-difference operator. As a result, arbitrary nonplanar fractures can be explicitly represented on the mesh without extra computational cost. In contrast to schemes based on effective-medium theory, no stability problem arises here when incorporating fractures with any fracture compliance. The proposed scheme allows the background medium to be heterogeneous and, furthermore, allows the medium to differ on both sides of the fracture. In comparison with the seismic response calculation in the background medium in the absence of the fractures, the additional computational cost and memory requirements for incorporating many fractures are small. Examples of seismic-wave scattering from single horizontal and tilted fractures as well as a set of parallel tilted fractures demonstrate the good behavior of the proposed algorithm.'],\n",

To demonstrate, we use a 2D section of the EAGE/SEG salt model and assemble a suite of the most common operators.

       " {u'abstract': [u'This paper presents a 3D least-squares wave-equation migration method that yields regularized common-image gathers (CIGs) for amplitude-versus-angle (AVA) analysis. In least-squares migration, we pose seismic imaging as a linear inverse problem; this provides at least two advantages. First, we are able to incorporate model-space weighting operators that improve the amplitude fidelity of CIGs. Second, the influence of improperly sampled data (footprint noise) can be diminished by incorporating data-space weighting operators. To investigate the viability of this class of methods for oil and gas exploration, we test the algorithm with a real-data example from the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. To make our problem computationally feasible, we utilize the 3D common-azimuth approximation in the migration algorithm. The inversion algorithm uses the method of conjugate gradients with the addition of a ray-parameter-dependent smoothing constraint that minimizes sampling and aperture artifacts. We show that more robust AVA attributes can be obtained by properly selecting the model and data-space regularization operators. The algorithm is implemented in conjunction with a preconditioning strategy to accelerate convergence. Posing the migration problem as an inverse problem leads to enhanced event continuity in CIGs and, hence, more reliable AVA estimates. The vertical resolution of the inverted image also improves as a consequence of increased coherence in CIGs and, in addition, by implicitly introducing migration deconvolution in the inversion.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u\"Multiple reflections contain subsurface reflectivity information which often complements that found in primary reflections. Previous attempts to combine the additional information by summing prestack images of the primaries and multiples have generally failed because of crosstalk leakage between the images. We present a general linear least-squares joint imaging of multiples-and primaries (LSJIMP) inversion method to simultaneously suppress crosstalk noise and combine pegleg multiples and primaries in a prestack sense. In general, LSJIMP is compatible with a wide variety of prestack imaging methods and can be extended to jointly image primaries and other embedded wave modes such as shear-wave conversions. We present a particular LSJIMP implementation that utilizes an efficient linear operator to model and image pegleg multiples in a true relative-amplitude sense. Applied to a given type of pegleg multiple in the data, our imaging operator produces an image directly comparable to primaries after NMO. Our operator's kinematic component is an extension of the NMO equation that independently images split peglegs in a moderately heterogeneous earth. Its amplitude component corrects multiples for their differences in angle-dependent reflection strength and illumination, relative to a primary. We test our LSJIMP implementation on 2D and 3D prestack field data examples and show that the method cleanly separates primaries and multiples and also uses joint information in the events to interpolate the signal in acquisition gaps.\"],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'Elastic properties of rocks depend on tectonic stress. Using the theory of poroelasticity as a constraint, we analyze features of these dependencies related to changes in rock pore-space geometry. We develop a formalism describing elastic moduli and anisotropy of rocks as nonlinear functions of confining stress and pore pressure. This formalism appears to agree with laboratory observations. To a first approximation, elastic moduli and seismic velocities as well as porosity depend only on the difference between the confining tectonic stress and pore pressure. However, in general, both the confining stress tensor and the pore pressure must be taken into account as independent variables. The stress-dependent geometry of the pore space fully controls the stress-induced changes in elastic moduli and seismic velocities. Specifically, the compliant porosity plays the most important role, despite the fact that in many rocks the compliant porosity is a very small part of total porosity. Changes in compliant porosity with pressure and stress explain the often observed behavior of elastic moduli: in the low compressive stress regime \\u2014 say, below 50 to 100 MPa \\u2014 moduli increase rapidly and then taper exponentially into a flat and linear increase with increasing load. Taking into account the strain of the compliant pore space, we introduce a tensor quantity defining the sensitivity of elastic moduli of rocks to the difference between confining stress and pore pressure. We call it the stress sensitivity tensor. This tensor is an important physical characteristic directly related to elastic nonlinearity of rocks. The stress sensitivity tensor governs the changes in elastic anisotropy of a drained poroelastic system as it depends upon the applied load.'],\n",

The site is located within the Romashkinskoye oil field (Tatarstan Republic, Russian Federation). Results of geochemical and hydrochemical surveys, as well as those of electrical profiling, revealed no individual haloes of contaminant in the soil and groundwater, which suggests that the entire site is contaminated. Vertical electrical IP soundings (VES-IP) allowed us to obtain the stratigraphic characteristics of the site and to distinguish a shallow aquifer among clayey  aquitards. Interpretation of SP data on the basis of forward numerical modeling helped us to develop a groundwater-flow model of the site. To reduce ambiguities, we kept fixed the values of layer resistivity derived from the inverted VES-IP data. Boundary conditions on water head and water flow were based on drilling and sampling data. We varied only the values of hydraulic conductivity to fit the calculated SP values to the measured SP values. We found a strong misfit between the measured and calculated SP values for the one-aquifer model. By inferring a second, deeper-seated aquifer, we computed a two-aquifer model that produced a satisfactory SP fit.'],\n",

The noise can be reduced or eliminated by prefiltering the data with an adaptive correlation noise-canceling filter using instrument tilt records prior to estimation of magnetotelluric (MT) response functions. Similar effects are to be expected in other shallow-water environments, and the adaptive correlation canceler is a suitable method to preprocess MT data to reduce motion-related noise in the magnetic field.

The energy in this band exhibits both diurnal and annual variation; magnetic-field amplitudes during the daytime are often well below the noise levels of existing sensors (coil magnetometers), thus reducing the effectiveness of the method for quantitative high-resolution studies of near-surface targets. To overcome this deficiency, we propose a hybrid acquisition and processing methodology based on combining the telluric-telluric (T-T) and telluric-magnetotelluric (T-MT) methods in this frequency range. Our method records the telluric channels at several sites and at base and remote reference stations during the day and records the full magnetotelluric (MT) components at the base and remote stations only during the night. Applying a tensor multiplicative relationship between these responses, we obtain the T-MT AMT transfer functions for the sites; these transfer functions can represent a reasonable approximation of the real AMT impedance tensors. To test the approach, a T-MT experiment was carried out in Sudbury, northern Ontario, during summer 2000. We compare the processed daytime data using the conventional MT approach to those obtained from our T-MT approach. The results demonstrate that our method can determine high-quality estimates in the dead band, although the estimates can be severely affected by noise.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u\"For 3D seismic imaging in structurally complex areas, the use of migration by wavefield extrapolation has become widespread. By its very nature, this family of migration methods operates on data sets that  satisfy a wave equation in the context of a single, physically realizable field experiment, such as a common-shot record. However, common-shot migration of data recorded over dipping structures requires a migration aperture much larger than the recording aperture, resulting in extra computations. A different type of wave-equation record, the response to a linear or planar source, can be synthesized from all the common-shot records. Synthesizing these records from common-shot records involves slant-stack processing, or applying delays to the various shots; we call these records delayed-shot records. Delayed-shot records don't suffer from the aperture problems of common-shot records since their recording aperture is the length of the seismic survey. Consequently, delayed-shot records hold potential for efficient, accurate imaging by wavefield extrapolation. We present a formulation of delayed-shot migration in 2D and 3D (linear sources) and its application to 3D marine streamer data. This formulation includes a discussion of sampling theory issues associated with the formation of delayed-shot records. For typical marine data, 2D and 3D delayed-shot migration can be significantly more efficient than common-shot migration. Synthetic and real data examples show that delayed-shot migration produces images comparable to those from common-shot migration.\"],\n",

Such expressions are particularly important for azimuthally anisotropic models in which variations of geometrical spreading with both offset and azimuth can significantly distort the results of wide-azimuth amplitude-variation-with-offset (AVO) analysis. Here, we present an equation for relative geometrical spreading in laterally homogeneous, arbitrarily anisotropic media as a simple function of the spatial derivatives of reflection traveltimes. By employing the Tsvankin-Thomsen nonhyperbolic moveout equation, the spreading is represented through the moveout coefficients, which can be estimated from surface seismic data. This formulation is then applied to P-wave reflections in an orthorhombic layer to evaluate the distortions of the geometrical spreading caused by both polar and azimuthal anisotropy. The relative geometrical spreading of P-waves in homogeneous orthorhombic media is controlled by five parameters that are also responsible for time processing. The weak-anisotropy approximation, verified by numerical tests, shows that azimuthal velocity variations contribute significantly to geometrical spreading, and the existing equations for transversely isotropic media with a vertical symmetry axis (VTI) cannot be applied even in the vertical symmetry planes. The shape of the azimuthally varying spreading factor is close to an ellipse for offsets smaller than the reflector depth but becomes more complicated for larger offset-to-depth ratios. The overall magnitude of the azimuthal variation of the geometrical spreading for the moderately anisotropic model used in the tests exceeds 25% for a wide range of offsets. While the methodology developed here is helpful in modeling and analyzing anisotropic geometrical spreading, its main practical application is in correcting the wide-azimuth AVO signature for the influence of the anisotropic overburden.\"],\n",

We estimate the fracture orientation, fracture porosity, and coefficient of anisotropy of the fractured rock mass at the selected sites from the azimuthal resistivity measurements; the specific surface area is estimated from field geological mapping of outcrops. High correlations exist between the specific surface area and the real and imaginary parts of the measured resistivity of the fractured rock mass.

The seismic velocities indicate that hydrate concentrations in the pore space of sediments range between 3% and 6% in a zone that is as much as 50 m thick overlying the BSR. Hydrates are most likely disseminated, neither cementing the sediment matrix nor affecting the stiffness of the matrix noticeably. Average free-gas concentrations beneath the hydrate stability zone are approximately 0.4% to 0.8% of the pore volume, assuming a homogeneous gas distribution.

The evolution of seismic attributes is closely linked to advances in computer technology. As examples, the advent of digital recording in the 1960s produced improved measurements of seismic amplitude and pointed out the correlation between hydrocarbon pore fluids and strong amplitudes (\\u201cbright spots\\u201d). The introduction of color printers in the early 1970s allowed color displays of reflection strength, frequency, phase, and interval velocity to be overlain routinely on black-and-white seismic records. Interpretation workstations in the 1980s provided interpreters with the ability to interact quickly with data to change scales and colors and to easily integrate seismic traces with other information such as well logs. Today, very powerful computer workstations capable of integrating large volumes of diverse data and calculating numerous seismic attributes are a routine tool used by seismic interpreters seeking geologic and reservoir engineering information from seismic data.

       " {u'abstract': [u'I analyze the problem of estimating differences in the arrival times of a seismic wavefront recorded by an array of sensors. The two-sensor problem is tackled first, showing that even an approximate knowledge of the wavelet, such as its power spectrum, can substantially increase the accuracy of the time-delay estimate and reduce the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) threshold for reliable time-delay estimation. The use of the complex trace, although beneficial for time-delay estimates in the presence of frequency-independent phase shifts, reduces the estimation accuracy in poor S/N conditions. I compare the performance of five time-delay estimators for arrays of sensors. Four of five estimators are based on crosscorrelation with a reference signal derived according to one of the following criteria: one trace in the array randomly selected, the stack of all array traces, the stack of all array traces iteratively updated, and (possible only for synthetic data) the noise-free wavelet. Another method, which is referred to as integration of differential delays, is based on the solution of an overdetermined system of linear equations built using the time delays between each pair of sensors. In all the situations considered, the performance of crosscorrelation with a trace of the array randomly selected is significantly worse than the other methods. Integration of differential delays proved to be the best-performing method for a large range of S/N conditions, particularly in the presence of large fluctuations in time delays and large bandwidth. However, for small time delays with respect to the wavelet duration, or if a priori knowledge of the moveout can be used to detrend the original data, crosscorrelation with a stacked trace performs similarly to integration of differential delays.'],\n",

Multidimensional prediction-error filters (PEFs) approximate these patterns to separate noise and signal in a least-squares sense.

In an ideal case where accurate pattern models of both noise and signal exist, the pattern-based method recovers the primaries while preserving their amplitudes. In the more general case, the pattern model of the multiples is obtained by using the data as prediction operators.

       " {u'abstract': [u'Seismic data regularization, which spatially transforms irregularly sampled acquired data to regularly sampled data, is a long-standing problem in seismic data processing. Data regularization can be implemented using Fourier theory by using a method that estimates the spatial frequency content on an irregularly sampled grid. The data can then be reconstructed on any desired grid. Difficulties arise from the nonorthogonality of the global Fourier basis functions on an irregular grid, which results in the problem of \\u201cspectral leakage\\u201d: energy from one Fourier coefficient leaks onto others. We investigate the nonorthogonality of the Fourier basis on an irregularly sampled grid and propose a technique called \\u201cantileakage Fourier transform\\u201d to overcome the spectral leakage. In the antileakage Fourier transform, we first solve for the most energetic Fourier coefficient, assuming that it causes the most severe leakage. To attenuate all aliases and the leakage of this component onto other Fourier coefficients, the data component corresponding to this most energetic Fourier coefficient is subtracted from the original input on the irregular grid. We then use this new input to solve for the next Fourier coefficient, repeating the procedure until all Fourier coefficients are estimated. This procedure is equivalent to \\u201creorthogonalizing\\u201d the global Fourier basis on an irregularly sampled grid.

This approach models an individual wavefront as a mesh that is adaptively refined as the wave travels through an earth model. The algorithm, implemented here for quasi-compressional waves, provides an effective tool for modeling and analyzing a large vertical seismic-profile data set from the Gulf of Mexico. Seismic velocities in this region generally increase linearly with depth, but simulations show that an isotropic vertical-gradient model cannot accurately reproduce traveltimes of first arrivals. However, a simple velocity-analysis inversion based on the wavefront-construction method allows a straightforward estimation of improved isotropic and transversely isotropic models that significantly reduce the misfit between computed traveltimes and the observations. The goal of this analysis is to produce a simple model suitable for use as a starting point for migrations and for assessing the importance of anisotropy in the field site. In fact, the final anisotropic model is much more consistent with background geologic information than the best isotropic model, which also has a larger rms traveltime error.

Numerical results show excellent agreement between the two models for wavefields away from the fracture; the only discrepancy between the two is the presence of a slow wave traveling primarily within the fracture fluid of the thin-layer model.

Our approach combines this geophysical data information with prior information on seismic compressional velocities and the structural interpretation of seismic sections. We constrain expected seismic velocities in the prior model using information from well logs from a nearby area. The layered structure and prior positions of the interfaces follow information from the seismic section obtained by processing the short offsets. Instead of using a conventional regularization technique to smooth the interface-velocity model, we describe the spatial correlation of interfaces and velocities with a geostatistical model, using a multivariate Gaussian probability density function. We impose a covariance function on the velocity field in each layer and on each interface in the model to control the smoothness of the solution. The inversion is performed by minimizing an objective function with two terms, one term measuring traveltime residuals and the other measuring the fit to the statistical model. We calculate the posterior uncertainties and evaluate the relative influence of data and the prior model on estimated interface depths and seismic velocities. The method results in the estimation of velocity and interface geometry beneath a basaltic sill system down to 7 km depth.

Images derived from both techniques must be interpreted with a knowledge of the theoretical resolution and limitations imposed by each measurement geometry and imaging algorithm. The reflection algorithm leads to images that contain hollow objects, a consequence of the reflection geometry and linearized theory; this algorithm is unable to image the sides of objects because of a lack of information at oblique reflection angles.

       " {u'abstract': [u\"Detailed knowledge of near-surface P- and S-wave velocities is important for processing and interpreting multicomponent land seismic data because (1) the entire wavefield passes through and is influenced by the near-surface soil conditions, (2) both source repeatability and receiver coupling also depend on these conditions, and (3) near-surface P- and S-wave velocities are required for wavefield decomposition and demultiple methods. However, it is often difficult to measure these velocities with conventional techniques because sensitivity to shallow-wave velocities is low and because of the presence of sharp velocity contrasts or gradients close to the earth's free surface. We demonstrate that these near-surface P- and S-wave velocities can be obtained using a propagator inversion. This approach requires data recorded by at least one multicomponent geophone at the surface and an additional multicomponent geophone at depth. The propagator between them then contains all information on the medium parameters governing wave propagation between the geophones at the surface and at depth. Hence, inverting the propagator gives local estimates for these parameters. This technique has been applied to data acquired in Zeist, the Netherlands. The near-surface sediments at this site are unconsolidated sands with a thin vegetation soil on top, and the sediments considered are located above the groundwater table. A buried geophone was positioned 1.05 m beneath receivers on the surface. Propagator inversion yielded low near-surface velocities, namely, 270 \\xb1 15 m/s for the compressional-wave velocity, which is well below the sound velocity in air, and 150 \\xb1 9 m/s for the shear velocity. Existing methods designed for imaging deeper structures cannot resolve these shallow material properties. Furthermore, velocities usually increase rapidly with depth close to the earth's surface because of increasing confining pressure. We suspect that for this reason, subsonic near-surface P-wave velocities are not commonly observed.\"],\n",

Quasi-static deformation occurs when the displacements are so slow that we may neglect inertial terms in the equations of motion. We present a method for inferring reservoir volume change and flow properties, such as permeability, from observations of quasi-static deformation. Such displacements may represent surface deformation such as tilt, leveling, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), or bathymetry observations or subsurface deformation, as inferred from time-lapse seismic surveys. In our approach, the equation for fluid flow in a deforming reservoir provides a mapping from estimated fractional volume changes to reservoir permeability variations. If the reservoir behaves poroelastically over the interval of interest, all the steps in this approach are linear. Thus, the inference of reservoir permeability from deformation data becomes a linear inverse problem. In an application to the Wilmington oil field in California, we find that observed surface displacements, obtained by leveling and InSAR, are indeed compatible with measured reservoir volume fluxes. We find that the permeability variations in certain layers coincide with fault-block boundaries suggesting that, in some cases, faults are controlling fluid flow at depth.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'An important problem in the interpretation of magnetic data is quantifying the source parameters that describe the anomalous structure. We present a new method that uses various combinations of the local wavenumbers for estimating the depth and shape (structural index) of the structure. Because the estimates are derived from third derivatives of the magnetic data, they are noisy. However, there are multiple ways of calculating the depth and index, and these solutions can be averaged to give a stable estimate. Even so, a synthetic test shows that the results are erratic away from the locations where the analytic-signal amplitude is large. Hence, when we generate images of the depth and structural index, we make the results most visible where the analytic-signal amplitude is large and less visible where the signal is small. The advantage of the method is that estimates can be obtained at all locations on a profile and used to generate continuous profiles or images of the source parameters. This can be used to help identify the locations where interference might be corrupting the results. The structural index image can be used to determine the most appropriate type of model for an area. Assuming this model, it is possible to calculate the depth that would be consistent with the model and the data. Knowing both the depth and model, the analytic-signal amplitude can be converted to apparent susceptibility. If a vertical-contact model is assumed, the susceptibility contrast across the contact can be imaged. For the thin-sheet and horizontal-cylinder models, we can image the susceptibility-thickness and susceptibility-area products, respectively.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'The North American gravity database as well as data-bases from Canada, Mexico, and the United States are being revised to improve their coverage, versatility, and accuracy. An important part of this effort is revising procedures for calculating gravity anomalies, taking into account our enhanced computational power, improved terrain databases and datums, and increased interest in more accurately defining long-wavelength anomaly components. Users of the databases may note minor differences between previous and revised database values as a result of these procedures. Generally, the differences do not impact the interpretation of local anomalies but do improve regional anomaly studies. The most striking revision is the use of the internationally accepted terrestrial ellipsoid for the height datum of gravity stations rather than the conventionally used geoid or sea level. Principal facts of gravity observations and anomalies based on both revised and previous procedures together with germane metadata will be available on an interactive Web-based data system as well as from national agencies and data centers. The use of the revised procedures is encouraged for gravity data reduction because of the widespread use of the global positioning system in gravity fieldwork and the need for increased accuracy and precision of anomalies and consistency with North American and national databases. Anomalies based on the revised standards should be preceded by the adjective \\u201cellipsoidal\\u201d to differentiate anomalies calculated using heights with respect to the ellipsoid from those based on conventional elevations referenced to the geoid.'],\n",

However, concern has been expressed about the vulnerability of high-frequency EM signals to the influence of the displacement current, especially the phase shift of the HEM signal resulting from the finite speed of light that describes the propagation of the EM wave in free space. In this paper we investigate the influence of the displacement current and the finite speed of light on HEM responses, based on a full solution of the EM field for a conductive, magnetically, and  dielectrically polarizable earth half-space and an overlying half-space of air with free-space dielectric permittivity. We calculate the amplitude change and the phase shift of the HEM signal and the change in the apparent resistivity. We find that the displacement current, when both the air and the earth half-space assume the free-space dielectric permittivity, has a small influence on the HEM signal, while substantial influence may occur when the earth is dielectrically polarizable. The finite speed of the EM propagation in free space does not result in significant phase changes in the HEM signal.'],\n",

Here, we describe a recently developed true-amplitude implementation of modified one-way operators and present some numerical examples. By \\u201ctrue-amplitude\\u201d one-way forward modeling we mean that the solutions are dynamically correct as well as kinematically correct. That is, ray theory applied to these equations yields the upward- and downward-traveling eikonal equations of the full wave equation, and the amplitude satisfies the transport equation of the full wave equation. The solutions of these equations are used in the standard wave-equation migration imaging condition. The boundary data for the downgoing wave is also modified from the one used in the classic theory because the latter data is not consistent with a point source for the full wave equation. When the full wave-form solutions are replaced by their ray-theoretic approximations, the imaging formula reduces to the common-shot Kirchhoff inversion formula. In this sense, the migration is true amplitude as well. On the other hand, this new method retains all of the fidelity features of wave equation migration. Computer output using numerically generated data confirms the accuracy of this inversion method. However, there are practical limitations. The observed data must be a solution of the wave equation. Therefore, the data must be collected from a single common-shot experiment. Multiexperiment data, such as common-offset data, cannot be used with this method as presently formulated.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u\"The beginning of digital signal processing took place in the years 1950 to 1954. Using an econometric model, E. A. Robinson in 1951 came up with the method of deconvolution, which he tested on 32 seismic traces. Norbert Wiener, George Wadsworth, Paul Samuelson, and Robert Solow were his advisors. On the basis of this work, the MIT president's office in 1952 set up and sponsored the Geophysical Analysis Group (GAG) in the Department of Geology and Geophysics. GAG was made up of graduate students doing research in digital signal processing. In 1953, a consortium of oil and geophysical companies took over the sponsorship. At first, GAG used the MIT Whirlwind digital computer. In order to do the larger amount of computing required by the consortium, the Computer Service Section of Raytheon Manufacturing Company was enlisted in 1953. The Raytheon people who played key roles were Richard Clippinger, Bernard Dimsdale, and Joseph H. Levin, all of whom had worked on  ENIAC, the world's first electronic digital computer. As originally built, ENIAC did not use programs stored in memory as does a modern computer; instead, the programming was done by rewiring the physical components for each new problem. In 1948, Clippinger was responsible for converting ENIAC into the world's first operational stored-program computer. ENIAC had 20 accumulators but no other random access memory (RAM). The programs were stored in the function tables, which acted as programmable read-only memory(PROM). For GAG work in 1953, Raytheon used the British Ferranti Mark 1 computer (which was the commercial version of the Manchester Mark 1 computer, for which Alan Turing played a key role). This computer was installed at the University of Toronto to help in the design of the St. Lawrence Seaway. Raytheon was plagued by frequent breakdowns of the computer but still produced several hundred seismic deconvolutions for the summer GAG meeting in 1953. The consortium was pleased with the geophysical results but was disheartened by the unreliability of the current state of digital technology. As a result, GAG was directed to find analog ways to do deconvolution. Instead, GAG found that all of the analog methods, and in particular, electric frequency filtering, could be done by digital signal processing. In fact, the digital way provided greater accuracy than the analog way. At the spring meeting in 1954, GAG proposed that all analog processing be thrown out and replaced by digital signal processing. Raytheon was at the meeting and offered to obtain or build all the elements required for digital signal processing, from input to output. The conversion to digital was not done at the time. However, that step did happen in the early 1960s, and exploration geophysics has the distinction of being the first science to experience a total digital revolution. Digital processing today provides seismic images of the interior of the Earth so startling that they compare to images of the stars made by the Hubble telescope. (In fact, the digital method of deconvolution first developed in geophysics made possible the digital correction of the lens of the Hubble telescope.)\"],\n",

The extension of surface to internal multiples can be made by replacing shot records with common-focus-point (CFP) gathers, a CFP gather representing focused data with one source in the subsurface and all receivers at the surface (or vice versa for a receiver gather). The internal-multiple-removal algorithm can be formulated in terms of boundary-related and layer-related versions. In the boundary-related version, the internal multiples are removed for one downward-scattering reflector at a time. In the layer-related version, the internal multiples are removed for a sequence of downward-scattering reflectors at a time. An exact velocity model is not required, but proper muting is critical; muting becomes straightforward in the CFP domain. The strategy for applying the two versions of the multiple-removal algorithm is demonstrated on physical-model and field data.

Since current 3D marine acquisition geometries are very sparsely sampled in the crossline direction, the direct Fresnel summation of the multiple contributions, calculated for those surface positions at which a source and a receiver are present, cannot be applied without introducing severe aliasing effects. In this newly proposed method, the regular Fresnel summation is applied to the contributions in the densely sampled inline direction, but the crossline Fresnel summation is replaced with a sparse parametric inversion. With this procedure, 3D multiples can be predicted using the available input data.

We give a theoretical explanation of why this spectral hole occurs.

We show in addition that this behavior extends to velocity perturbations that can depend on the vertical variable, and spectral holes in velocity-versus-depth resolution can appear at any horizontal wavelength. Velocity perturbations with very simple vertical variation are sufficient to create these spectral holes. This behavior is not limited to extremely small apertures; the effect of this spectral hole can be felt when the maximum angle of incidence is as large as 25\\xb0.'],\n",

This greatly simplifies velocity determination of pure-mode data. Common-asymptotic-conversion-point (CACP) sorting of converted-wave data, on the other hand, only centers the apexes of all traveltimes around zero offset in arbitrarily complex but isotropic media with a constant P-wave/S-wave velocity ratio everywhere. A depth-varying CACP sorting may therefore be required to position all traveltimes properly around zero offset in structurally complex areas. Moreover, converted-wave moveout is nearly always asymmetric and nonhyperbolic.

       " {u'abstract': [u'We propose a method for estimating interval velocity using the kinematic information in defocused diffractions and reflections. We extract velocity information from defocused migrated events by analyzing their residual focusing in physical space (depth and midpoint) using prestack residual migration. The results of this residual-focusing analysis are fed to a linearized inversion procedure that produces interval velocity updates. Our inversion procedure uses a wavefield-continuation operator linking perturbations of interval velocities to perturbations of migrated images, based on the principles of wave-equation migration velocity analysis introduced in recent years. We measure the accuracy of the migration velocity using a diffraction-focusing criterion instead of the criterion of flatness of migrated common-image gathers that is commonly used in migration velocity analysis. This new criterion enables us to extract velocity information from events that would be challenging to use with conventional velocity analysis methods; thus, our method is a powerful complement to those conventional techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology using two examples. In the first example, we estimate interval velocity above a rugose salt top interface by using only the information contained in defocused diffracted and reflected events present in zero-offset data. By comparing the results of full prestack depth migration before and after the velocity updating, we confirm that our analysis of the diffracted events improves the velocity model. In the second example, we estimate the migration velocity function for a 2D, zero-offset, ground-penetrating radar data set. Depth migration after the velocity estimation improves the continuity of reflectors while focusing the diffracted energy.'],\n",

To include more seismic traces in the coherence estimation, we introduce a supertrace technique that constructs a new data cube by rearranging several adjacent seismic traces into a single supertrace. Combining our supertrace technique with the C1 and HOSC algorithms, we obtain two efficient coherence-estimation algorithms, which we call ST-C1 and ST-HOSC.

We find that, for transverse isotropic media with a vertical symmetry axis (TIV), the effect of weak anisotropy in the cap rock does not lead to significant errors in, for instance, the simultaneous determination of pore-pressure and fluid-saturation changes. On the other hand, changes in seismic anisotropy within the reservoir rock (caused by, for instance, increased fracturing) might be detectable from time-lapse seismic data.

The computed depths are plotted against the shape factors on a graph. The solution for the shape and depth of the buried structure is read at the common intersection of the depth-shape curves. The depth-shape curves method was successfully tested on theoretical data with and without random noise and applied to a known field example from Ontario.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u\"The design of surface ground-penetrating radar (GPR) antennas is inherently difficult, primarily because the presence of the air-soil interface greatly complicates both analytic and laboratory-based approaches aimed at characterizing the antennas. Versatile numerical simulation techniques capable of describing the key physical principles governing GPR antenna radiation offer new solutions to this problem. We use a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solution of Maxwell's equations in three dimensions to explore the radiation characteristics of various bow-tie antennas (including quasi-linear antennas) operating in different environments. The antenna panels are either modeled as having an infinite conductivity [i.e., a perfect electrical conductor (PEC)], a constant finite conductivity, or a Wu-King finite-conductivity profile. Finite conductivities are accommodated through a subcell extension of the classical FDTD approach, with the model space surrounded by highly efficient generalized perfectly matched layer (GPML) absorbing boundary conditions. Our results show that input impedances, radiated waveforms, and radiation patterns of bow-tie antennas with Wu-King conductivity profiles are largely invariant when placed in free space or above diverse half-space earth models. By comparison, antennas with PEC or constant finite-conductivity panels have variable characteristics that depend somewhat on their operating environment. Quasi-linear antenna designs tend to be less sensitive in this respect, and hence may be suitable for a somewhat larger variety of soil conditions than planar bow-tie antennas characterized by large flare angles. Antennas with constant finite-conductivity panels are considerably more robust (i.e., less sensitive to their environment) than their PEC analogs because the loss resistance is increased, and the range over which a significant amount of current flow occurs is decreased when the antenna panels are resistively loaded. For the extreme case of Wu-King conductivity profiles, the current in the antenna panels approaches that of a quasi-infinitesimal electric dipole. This is shown by the surface-charge distributions on the various antennas and by the corresponding energy radiation patterns. Unfortunately, the favorable characteristics of the latter antennas are counterbalanced by markedly lower radiation efficiency. For the antenna designs considered in this study, we found that the peak energy radiated into earth models from bow-tie antennas with Wu-King conductivity profiles is about one order of magnitude lower than for antennas with PEC terminals.\"],\n",

In this study, we systematically explore the usefulness of a conditional stochastic simulation approach based on simulated annealing for this purpose. First, we generate a realistic model of an alluvial aquifer consisting of a 2D scale-invariant porosity field. On the basis of this model, we generate synthetic neutron porosity logs and crosshole georadar tomographic surveys. We then use the proposed geostatistical simulation approach to integrate this hydrogeophysical database. The effectiveness of this approach to characterize the detailed porosity distribution in heterogeneous alluvial aquifers is assessed by comparing the results for a variety of simulated porosity fields that differ fundamentally in terms of their conditioning information.

Additionally, variograms from pure background conductivity maps show a power-law trend for all lags, whereas, in the presence of targets, a short power-law trend is followed by a sill corresponding to a loss in spatial correlation.

Four data sets at frequencies of 24, 90, 370, and 1000 Hz were obtained along a pair of monitoring boreholes located 80.5 m apart. Traveltime information was first extracted from these EM data sets using a wavefield transform with a ray series approximation. The conductivity contrast of each layer is no greater than two in the region of interest, so the first arrivals can be estimated within 5% error by the approximate scheme. A nonlinear traveltime tomography algorithm adopting a Fresnel zone concept was then applied to obtain the conductivity model between the boreholes. The resultant conductivity image represents the conductivity structure between the boreholes. This image is consistent with the results of both a finite-difference inversion and the induction log obtained prior to waterflooding. Comparing the two conductivity images with the induction logs, we observe major differences in the fracture-dominant resistive reservoir layer, which may have been caused by changes in reservoir condition before and after waterflooding.'],\n",

Single-frequency VLF data using magnetic measurements alone are often used to delineate lateral changes in electrical conductivity, e.g., fracture zones in crystalline terrains or changes in lithology in the sedimentary cover. Here, an attempt is made to add depth information to the conductivity distribution by realizing that the single-frequency VLF profile data contain information about (1) the background medium through their decay away from the conductors, (2) the position, and (3) the depth of the dominating conductors through the relative contribution of in-phase and quadrature components to the VLF anomaly in addition to the rate of change of the anomaly close to the conductors. Synthetic data from a model containing a shallow and a deeper conductor are filtered to show that the estimated current distributions coincide well with the horizontal position of the conductors, but even they provide some smeared images of the depth distribution of the conductors. A comparison with models obtained from regularized inversion of the same data shows good correspondence. The VLF field data from an area with clay lenses overlying wet sand and crystalline basement are filtered into current distributions that grossly mimic the electrical conductivity distribution of the clay lenses as obtained from radiomagnetotelluric measurements along the same profile.'],\n",

In an interbedded sandstone-shale Miocene succession in the Gulf of Mexico basin, a 90\\xb0-phase shift of nearly zero-phase seismic data significantly improves lithologic and stratigraphic interpretation. A match between seismic and acoustic impedance (AI) profiles results in a better tie between seismic amplitude traces and lithology-indicative logs. Better geometric imaging of AI units that does not use dual-polarity seismic events results in easier and more accurate reservoir delineation. Less amplitude distortion and the stratigraphy-independent nature of thin-bed interference significantly improves stratigraphic resolution and seismic stratigraphic profiling.

In this specific case, stratigraphic resolution of 90\\xb0-phase data is \\u03bb/4 (\\u03bb = wavelength), compared with \\u03bb/2 for its zero-phase counterpart. Stratal slices made from 90\\xb0-phase data show geomorphologic patterns of depositional systems with less noise and fewer interference fingerprints.

In Part 1, seismic models of Ricker wavelets with selected phases are constructed to assess interpretability of composite waveforms in increasingly complex geologic settings. Although superior for single surface and thick-layer interpretation, zero-phase seismic data are not optimal for interpreting beds thinner than a wavelength because their antisymmetric thin-bed responses tie to the reflectivity series rather than to impedance logs. Nonsymmetrical wavelets (e.g., minimum-phase wavelets) are generally not recommended for interpretation because their asymmetric composite waveforms have large side lobes. Integrated zero-phase traces are also less desirable because they lose high-frequency components in the integration process. However, the application of 90\\xb0-phase data consistently improves seismic interpretability. The unique symmetry of 90\\xb0-phase thin-bed response eliminates the dual polarity of thin-bed responses, resulting in better imagery of thin-bed geometry, impedance profiles, lithology, and stratigraphy. Less amplitude distortion and less stratigraphy-independent, thin-bed interference lead to more accurate acoustic impedance estimation from amplitude data and a better tie of seismic traces to lithology-indicative wireline logs.

This need prompted us to construct a detailed 3D representation of the subsurface geologic structure based on 2.75D forward modeling of 11 gravity and aeromagnetic profiles constrained by geologic data and physical (density, magnetic susceptibility, remanent magnetic) properties. Potential-fields modeling results provided greater definition of the alluvial basins, and when combined with well-log data, yield an overall basin volume surrounding Steamboat Hills that is 64% greater than the volume derived from well-log data alone. A representation of the geothermal reservoir, consisting of altered granodiorite and metamorphic rocks, illustrates that the flow of thermal water is fault controlled. The model also suggests that thermal water may upflow along an unexplored fault flanking western Steamboat Hills.

I include a bit of speculation about the future of seismic imaging, but the meat of the article is on seismic-imaging history. Based on the timing of their publications, I claim there are three key contributors to the theoretical developments of modern seismic imaging: F. Rieber, J. G. Hagedoorn, and  J. F. Claerbout. None of these men were the first to consider the seismic-imaging problem, but their papers and algorithms have probably been quoted more often than anyone else's. One certainly must give credit as well to C. H. Dix and M. M. Slotnick for similar contributions. Other names that come to mind include Hans Sattlegger in Germany, A. J. Berkhout in the Netherlands, Bill Schneider at GSI in Dallas, and Robert Stolt at CONOCO in Ponca City, Oklahoma. However, without the independent computational progression predicted by Moore's law (computer speed doubles every 18 months), the spectacular subsurface images produced today would not be possible. I hope to convince the reader that in addition to the development of the vast literature on seismic-imaging theory, another, less-publicized, parallel technological progression has focused on the development of efficient machines to produce, with minimal human intervention, an increasingly more accurate image of the strata below the recording instruments. Unfortunately, with a few key exceptions, the names of many of the contributors to this aspect of seismic imaging have been lost. The digital revolution in the 1960s appears to be the culmination of this attempt at mechanization, but not until the development of truly powerful scientific computers did the more accurate and advanced theoretical developments in seismic-imaging theory become practical to apply and use in the search for diminishing supplies of hydrocarbons. In fact, one can argue that we still don't have sufficient computer power to do everything we need and want to do. But that's another story.\"],\n",

Currently, surface-consistent static and amplitude corrections correct for rapid variations in arrival times and amplitudes of a reflector, but these methods impose strong assumptions on the near-surface model. Observations on synthetic and laboratory experiments of near-surface scattering with densely sampled data suggest that removing noise from near-receiver scattering requires multichannel approaches rather than single-channel, near-surface corrections. In this paper we develop a wavefield-based imaging method to suppress surface waves scattered directly beneath the receivers. Using an integral-equation formulation, we account for near-surface heterogeneities by a surface impedance function. This impedance function is used to model scattered surface waves, excited by upcoming wavefronts. The final step in our algorithm is to subtract the scattered surface waves.

Then, ray tracing from the reflection points for nonzero reflection angles defines the source and receiver locations of the data traces in the CRP gather. These traces are then prestack depth migrated, and the interval velocity model adjustment is obtained by fitting the velocity that maximizes the stack amplitude over the predicted (nonhyperbolic) moveout. A small number (2\\u20133) of iterations converge to a 2D model of layer shape and interval velocity. Further efficiency is obtained by implementing layer stripping. The computation time is greatly reduced by combining parsimonious migration with processing only the salient portions of the whole seismic data set. The algorithm can handle lateral velocity variation within each layer as well as constant velocity. The computation time of the proposed algorithm is of the same order as that of the standard rms velocity scan method, but it does not have the inherent assumptions of the velocity scan method and is faster than current iterative prestack depth migration velocity analysis methods for typical field data.'],\n",

Most of the computational effort in traveltime tomography comes from computing traveltimes and their Fr\\xe9chet derivatives, which for ray-based methods can be computed directly. However, in most wave-equation traveltime-tomography algorithms, the steepest descent direction of the objective function is computed by the backprojection algorithm, without computing a Fr\\xe9chet derivative directly. We propose a new wave-based refraction-traveltime\\u2013tomography procedure that computes Fr\\xe9chet derivatives directly and efficiently. Our method involves solving a damped-wave equation using a frequency-domain, finite-element modeling algorithm at a single frequency and invoking the reciprocity theorem. A damping factor, which is commonly used to suppress wraparound effects in frequency-domain modeling, plays the role of suppressing multievent wavefields. By limiting the wavefield to a single first arrival, we are able to extract the first-arrival traveltime from the phase term without applying a time window. Computing the partial derivative of the damped wave-equation solution using the reciprocity theorem enables us to compute the Fr\\xe9chet derivative of amplitude, as well as that of traveltime, with respect to subsurface parameters. Using the Marmousi-2 model, we demonstrate numerically that refraction traveltime tomography with large-offset data can be used to provide the smooth initial velocity model necessary for prestack depth migration.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u\"This paper shows that Betti's reciprocity theorem gives an integral equation procedure to eliminate from the physical multicomponent-source, multicomponent-receiver seismic measurements the effect of the physical source radiation pattern and the response of the physical overburden (that is, the medium above the receiver plane). The physical multicomponent sources are assumed to be orthogonally aligned anywhere above the multicomponent-receiver depth level. Other than the position of the sources, no source characteristics are required. The method, denoted the Betti designature/elastic demultiple, has the following additional characteristics: it preserves primary amplitudes while eliminating all waves scattered from the overburden; it requires no knowledge of the medium below the receiver level; it requires no knowledge of the medium above the receiver level; it requires information only of the local density and elastic wave propagation velocities at the receiver level to decompose the physical seismic measurements into upgoing and downgoing waves. Following the Betti designature/elastic demultiple step is an elastic wavefield decomposition step that decomposes the data into PP-, PS-, SP-, and SS-wave responses that would be recorded from idealized compressional-wave and shear-wave sources and receivers. The combined elastic wavefield decomposition on the source and receiver side gives data equivalent to data from a hypothetical survey with overburden absent, with single-component compressional and shear-wave sources, and single-component compressional and shear-wave receivers. When the medium is horizontally layered, the Betti designature/elastic demultiple scheme followed by the elastic source-receiver decomposition scheme greatly simplifies and is conveniently implemented as deterministic multidimensional deconvolution and elastic source-receiver wavefield decomposition of common-source gathers (or common-receiver gathers when source array variations are negligible). Betti designature/elastic demultiple followed by source-receiver wavefield decomposition applies to three different seismic experiments: a 9-component (9C) land seismic experiment, a 12-component (12C) ocean-bottom seismic experiment, and an 18-component (18C) borehole seismic experiment. For the land and ocean-bottom seismic experiments, an additional geophone should be deployed below the zero-offset geophone to predict the source-induced vertical traction vector at the source location. A numerical example for the 12C ocean-bottom seismic experiment over a horizontally layered medium validates the Betti designature/elastic demultiple scheme.\"],\n",

Pore fluids can increase the magnitude of shear energy stored in this modulus by an amount that ranges from the smallest to the largest effective shear moduli of the VTI system. But since there are five shear moduli in play, the overall increase in shear energy due to fluids is reduced by a factor of about five in general.

We then invert the corresponding synthetic data on selected profiles, using both traditional MT approaches, as well as the proposed approach, which is based on the determinant of the MT impedance tensor. We compare the estimated resistivity models with the true models along the selected profiles and find that the traditional approaches often lead to strongly biased models and bad data fit, in contrast to those using the determinant. In this case, much of the bias is removed and the data fit is improved.

The prestressed medium is modeled as an unstressed medium with the stress effect replaced by effective elastic moduli. The effective, unstressed medium is acoustically anisotropic. Because the medium is inhomogeneous due to the local stress concentrations around the borehole, the anisotropy tensor varies in space. To avoid the use of a full anisotropy tensor, the effective medium is assumed to be transversely isotropic (TI) with a symmetry axis parallel to the minimum stress direction. The elastic moduli of the TI medium are determined from the shear velocities of the unstressed medium using an empirical relation between static stress and shear velocities. The effective medium is then modeled with the conventional finite-difference time-domain method. The effective-medium approach successfully predicts the known first-order effects of stress; that is, shear-wave splitting for a monopole source and dispersion crossover for cross-dipole sources. It also shows that the dipole wave-dispersion crossover frequency decreases linearly with increasing borehole radius. With the effective medium model, we study the interaction of quadrupole waves excited and recorded in a vertical well with static formation stress. It is shown that the quadrupole wave in a prestressed formation splits into a fast wave and a slow wave. The velocities of the waves are similar to those of crossed-dipole waves in the same formation. Both waves are faster than quadrupole waveforms without stress. Moreover, the wave splitting is observed for different tool orientations in the borehole and different borehole sizes. Therefore, the wave splitting may be used as an indication of static formation stress if the medium without stress is isotropic.'],\n",

When considering the application of stretching to transform elliptically anisotropic media into isotropic media, the auxiliary angle is a natural one to use because both \\u03b8 and \\u03d5 \\u2192 \\u03b1 under such stretching. Our present formulation for TI media makes the assumption of elliptical anisotropy, which is valid generally for SH-waves but only as a special case for P-and SV-waves, where, in the SV case, the only possible ellipses are circles. Nevertheless, the theory has useful applications for P-waves over limited ranges of propagation direction (e.g., in the short-spread approximation). Our formulation provides explicit results for all angles of incidence and for what we term an angular unconformity between two TI media, that is, for all orientations of the axes of symmetry for each of the media, and for all orientations of the interface, assuming these two axes and the interface normal to lie in the same vertical plane. Our conclusions have been verified by showing that the phase angles and phase velocities of the incident and refracted waves obey Snell's law across the interface. We also demonstrate, using auxiliary angles, that the description of refraction between elliptically anisotropic media by stretching the media to make them isotropic, then applying isotropic refraction, is also valid for our general angular-unconformity case. However, both stretching (1D) and either scaling (2D) or shearing must be applied correctly and separately to the two media. The refraction algorithm developed from this theory and another developed by Byun in terms of phase-velocity theory are currently the only published noniterative algorithms known to us for refraction across an angular unconformity where the axes of anisotropy are parallel neither to each other nor to the interface. Based on this theory, we have developed a demonstration program, AUXDEMOC, that computes the refracted-ray angles for any combination of parameters by the two equivalent methods: (1) anisotropic refraction and (2) stretching plus isotropic refraction.

We derive the dispersion relation for a scalar qP-wave using elastic wave equations for anisotropic media. By applying a rational approximation to the dispersion relation, we obtain a one-way, dual-domain, scalar qP-wave propagator for heterogeneous VTI media. The propagator includes a phase-shift term and both phase-screen and large-angle correction terms. The phase-shift term is implemented in the wavenumber domain, while the other terms are implemented in the space domain. Fourier transformations are used to shuttle the wavefield between the two domains. This propagator can be used to propagate qP-wavefields within an isotropic or a VTI medium, with either medium containing lateral heterogeneities. Error analysis of the impulse response and dispersion relations demonstrates that the propagator is accurate and stable and has a wide-angle capability. The application of the propagator to the imaging of qP-wave data with VTI models which contain complex structures and large perturbations of velocity and anisotropy results in excellent image quality.

If shear waves are not excited, SS traveltimes can be found from PP and PS (converted-wave) data, which makes the method applicable to offshore surveys. The feasibility of parameter estimation is strongly dependent on reflector dip and orientation. For a horizontal reflector beneath a single orthorhombic layer, the vertical velocities and reflector depth cannot be found from conventional-spread reflection traveltimes alone. If the reflector is dipping, the inversion is ambiguous when the dip plane is close to one of the vertical symmetry planes of the orthorhombic layer above it. The parameter estimation becomes possible if the dip direction deviates by more than 10\\xb0 from the nearest symmetry plane. We apply multicomponent stacking velocity tomography to perform velocity analysis for stratified orthorhombic models composed of homogeneous layers separated by plane or curved interfaces. The tomographic algorithm, which operates with the normal-moveout (NMO) ellipses, zero-offset traveltimes, and reflection time slopes of PP- and SS-waves, is designed to build the orthorhombic velocity model in the depth domain by estimating the anisotropic parameters and the shapes of the reflecting interfaces. Numerical tests show that for layered orthorhombic media, it is necessary to put constraints on the vertical velocities to avoid instability in the inversion of noise-contaminated reflection data.\"],\n",

For a given velocity model, primaries and multiples have different angle-domain moveout and, therefore, can be separated using techniques similar to the ones employed in the data space prior to migration. We use Radon transforms in the image space to discriminate between primaries and multiples and employ accurate functions describing angle-domain moveouts. Since every individual angle-domain common-image gather incorporates complex 3D propagation effects, our method has the advantage of working with 3D data and complicated geology. Therefore, our method offers an alternative to the more expensive surface-related multiple-elimination (SRME) approach operating in the data space. Radon transforms are cheap but not necessarily ideal for separating primaries and multiples, particularly at small angles where the moveout discrepancy between the two kinds of events are not large. Better techniques involving signal/noise separation using prediction-error filters can be employed as well, although such approaches fall outside the scope of this paper. We demonstrate, using synthetic and real data examples, the power of our method in discriminating between primaries and multiples after migration by wavefield extrapolation, followed by transformation to the angle domain.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'A new method is presented for seismic deghosting of towed streamer data acquired in rough seas. The deghosting scheme combines pressure recordings along one or several cables with an estimate of the vertical pressure gradient (or the vertical component of the particle velocity). The estimation of the vertical pressure gradient requires continuous elevation measurements of the wave height directly above the receivers. The vertical pressure gradient estimate is obtained by spatially weighting the pressure field. Each spatial weight generally is the product of two weight functions. The first is a function of partial derivatives acting solely along the horizontal Cartesian coordinates. It can be implemented by finite-difference or Fourier derivative operations. The second is a function of the vertical Cartesian coordinate and accounts for the varying sea state. This weight can be changed from one receiver to the next, making the deghosting a local process. Integrated with the measured pressure field, the estimate of the vertical pressure gradient also enables other seismic processing opportunities beyond deghosting.'],\n",

At its most basic level, radiative transfer predicts that the wavefield separates into a coherent, or wavelike, part and an incoherent, or diffusive, flow after a length scale known as a mean free path. The dynamic properties of the coherent and incoherent wavefield are linked. For 1D Rayleigh scatterers, or thin beds, we show that the exponential decay of the coherent wave predicted by radiative transfer corresponds to the decay predicted by the O'Doherty\\u2013Anstey formula. This equivalence reveals an underlying relationship between radiative transfer and mean field theory.

       " {u'abstract': [u'Reflection seismic data continuation is the computation of data at source and receiver locations that differ from those in the original data, using whatever data are available. We develop a general theory of data continuation in the presence of caustics and illustrate it with three examples: dip moveout (DMO), azimuth moveout (AMO), and offset continuation. This theory does not require knowledge of the reflector positions. We construct the output data set from the input through the composition of three operators: an imaging operator, a modeling operator, and a restriction operator. This results in a single operator that maps directly from the input data to the desired output data. We use the calculus of Fourier integral operators to develop this theory in the presence of caustics. For both DMO and AMO, we compute impulse responses in a constant-velocity model and in a more complicated model in which caustics arise. This analysis reveals errors that can be introduced by assuming, for example, a model with a constant vertical velocity gradient when the true model is laterally heterogeneous. Data continuation uses as input a subset (common offset, common angle) of the available data, which may introduce artifacts in the continued data. One could suppress these artifacts by stacking over a neighborhood of input data (using a small range of offsets or angles, for example). We test data continuation on synthetic data from a model known to generate imaging artifacts. We show that stacking over input scattering angles suppresses artifacts in the continued data.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'Waveform inversion aims at a quantitative estimation of the subsurface model. Such a quantitative estimation is a nonlinear problem: the relation between elastic parameters and waveform data is basically nonlinear. Perturbations in the velocity give rise to severe nonlinear perturbations in the wavefield. Other severe nonlinear effects appear when the impedance profile is very irregular (i.e., rapidly oscillating). In this paper, we avoid these drastic nonlinear effects by assuming the velocity distribution is known, and we restrict our analysis to the reconstruction of \\u201cregular\\u201d impedance profiles. Even in this simple framework, deviations between a linear and a nonlinear model are cumulative as time increases, and the deviations cannot be neglected for propagation times of the order of standard seismic recordings. A nonlinear approach appears to be essential for quantitative imaging of deep targets. However a nonlinear approach requires the wavelet to be known with an accuracy that cannot be reached today. Our sensitivity analysis shows that the wavelet/model ambiguity is much more severe than the one met in linear inversion. As a consequence of the error accumulation inherent in a nonlinear wave propagation model, a small disturbance in the wavelet leads to a strong disturbance in the deep parts of the solution model. In this context, the classical approach for estimating the wavelet by minimizing the energy of the primary reflection waveform is not likely to provide the required accuracy except for very special cases. Accurate wavelet measurements thus appear to be a major challenge for a sound reconstruction of impedance profiles.'],\n",

Detection of boundaries is hampered, however, by coarse spatial resolution of the seismic data, together with local variability of acoustic impedance within formations. The authors propose a two-part approach to the problem, using neural networks and geostatistics. First, an artificial neural network is used for boundary detection. The training set for the neural net comprises seismic traces that are collocated with the borehole locations. Once the net is trained, it is applied to the entire seismic grid. Second, output from the neural network is processed geostatistically to filter noise and to assess the uncertainty of the boundary locations. A physical counterpart is interpreted for each structure inferred from the spatial semivariogram. Factorial kriging is used for filtering, and uncertainty in the shape of the boundaries is assessed by geostatistical simulation. In this approach, the boundary locations are interpreted as random functions that can be simulated to incorporate their uncertainty in applications.

The simulations were of four different models that included features such as a water-filled borehole and an antenna with resistive loading. For each model, radiation patterns for the far-field region were calculated. The radiation patterns show that the amplitude of the radar wave was strongly affected by its frequency, the water-filled borehole, the resistive loading of the antenna, and the external metal parts of the antenna (e.g., the cable head and the battery pack). For the models with a water-filled borehole, their normalized radiation patterns were practically identical to the normalized radiation pattern of a finite-length electric dipole when the wavelength in the formation was significantly greater than the total length of the radiating elements of the model antenna. The minimum wavelength at which this criterion was satisfied depended upon the features of the antenna, especially its external metal parts.'],\n",

These pipes appear to be randomly positioned. However, based on regional geologic structures revealed by Bouguer gravity anomalies, especially in a regional gravity map, their locations form a definite pattern. In the Narayanpet-Maddur region, regional Bouguer gravity contours exhibit some features of geologic interest: (1) the eastward convex regional contours show an increase in convexity from the Maddur and Kotakonda area on the east to Narayanpet on the west, (2) convexity is maximum in the vicinity of Narayanpet, where a large number of Kimberlite pipes occur nearly parallel to the regional contour, and (3) between Narayanpet and the Maddur-Kotakonda region, kimberlite pipes occur at intersections of three eastward, convex concentric zones with four lineaments, one trending northeast-southwest and the other three nearly east-west. These linear trends are believed to be radial, extensional, deep-fracture zones, through which kimberlite magma erupted about 1100 Ma. Modeling the residual gravity anomaly over one of the four profiles shows fairly good agreement between observed and computed fields. Based on analysis of Bouguer gravity anomalies and modeling of the residual gravity field, likely locations for kimberlite pipes are the contact zones between granite plutons and the country rocks that coincide with the northeast-southwest\\u2013trending radial faults that pass through Narayanpet and Kotakonda to the south and through Kazipur to the north.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'Interpretation of gravity data warrants uncertainty estimation because of its inherent nonuniqueness. Although the uncertainties in model parameters cannot be completely reduced, they can aid in the meaningful interpretation of results. Here we have employed a simulated annealing (SA)\\u2013based technique in the inversion of gravity data to derive multilayered earth models consisting of two and three dimensional bodies. In our approach, we assume that the density contrast is known, and we solve for the coordinates or shapes of the causative bodies, resulting in a nonlinear inverse problem. We attempt to sample the model space extensively so as to estimate several equally likely models. We then use all the models sampled by SA to construct an approximate, marginal posterior probability density function (PPD) in model space and several orders of moments. The correlation matrix clearly shows the interdependence of different model parameters and the corresponding trade-offs. Such correlation plots are used to study the effect of a priori information in reducing the uncertainty in the solutions. We also investigate the use of derivative information to obtain better depth resolution and to reduce underlying uncertainties. We applied the technique on two synthetic data sets and an airborne-gravity data set collected over Lake Vostok, East Antarctica, for which a priori constraints were derived from available seismic and radar profiles. The inversion results produced depths of the lake in the survey area along with the thickness of sediments. The resulting uncertainties are interpreted in terms of the experimental geometry and data error.'],\n",

       "   u'Despite the increasing use of controlled-source frequency-domain EM data to characterize shallow subsurface structures, relatively few inversion algorithms have been widely applied to data from real-world settings, particularly in high-conductivity terrains. In this study, we develop robust and convergent regularized, least-squares inversion algorithms based on both linear and nonlinear formulations of mutual dipole induction for the forward problem. A modified version of the discrepancy principle based on a priori information is implemented to select optimal smoothing parameters that simultaneously guarantee the stability and best-fit criteria. To investigate the problems of resolution and equivalence, we consider typical layered-earth models in one and two dimensions using both synthetic and observed data. Synthetic examples show that inversions based on the nonlinear forward model more accurately resolve subsurface structure, and that inversions based on the linear forward model tend to drastically underpredict high conductivities at depth. Inversions of actual field data from well-characterized sites (e.g., National Geotechnical Experimentation Site; sand-dominated coastal aquifer in the Georgia Bight) are used to test the applicability of the model to terrains with different characteristic conductivity structure. A comparison of our inversion results with existing cone-penetrometer and downhole-conductivity data from these field sites demonstrates the ability of the inversions to constrain conductivity variations in practical applications.'],\n",

A combination of approximately 30 radio frequencies and controlled-source frequencies is essential for penetrating the thick clay layers. The electromagnetic transfer functions of impedance tensor and tipper vectors point toward a structure that is largely two-dimensional, although clear three-dimensional effects can be observed where the sandy formation is close to the surface. The determinant of the impedance tensor was chosen for inversion using two-dimensional models. The final two-dimensional model fits the data to within twice the estimated standard errors, which is considered quite satisfactory, given that typical errors are on the level of 1% on the impedance elements. Comparison with bore-hole results and shallow-reflection seismic sections show that the information delivered by the electromagnetic data largely agrees with the former and provides useful information for interpreting the latter by identifying lithological boundaries between the clay and sand and between the sand and crystalline basement.'],\n",

With laboratory experiments on stressed boreholes, I show that high-resolution, shallow acoustic measurements made inside the borehole can detect these stress-induced velocity changes. The onset of damage can be predicted by comparing these shallow measurements to a deep velocity measurement in undamaged rock. When the maximum shallow velocity is decreased by damage and approaches the deep velocity, I infer that damage has occurred and breakouts and/or borehole failure are imminent.

       "   u'The dc electrical response of freshwater-saturated shaly sandstone is analyzed on the basis of effective volume conductivity concepts for a concentrated mixture of \\u201csolid grains\\u201d in a continuous electrolyte. The bulk conductivity of this model is physically controlled by (1) the effective porosity and the average electrical tortuosity of its free-pore electrolyte, and (2) the amount and concentration of bound water that coats charged solid surfaces (mainly of clays), and a corresponding averaged electrical surface tortuosity. The latter is combined in an equivalent volume conductivity that is mainly due to the electrical double layers of charges developed at the clay-electrolyte interfaces. Analytical expressions, based on effective medium and general mixture theories, are developed to describe both the whole rock conductivity and the specific conductivities of its constituent elements. The derived equations for the bulk conductivity of the system describe, with sufficient precision, experimental core data over a large range of water conductivity. The equations are also written in a modified Archie-Winsauer form, wherein their coefficients are shown to be strongly dependent on the electrolyte and matrix conductivity, the effective medium porosity, and the cementation exponent. The scheme is shown to describe satisfactorily laboratory data for clay gels, shales, and shaly sandstones saturated with saline to fresh water. The scheme can also be used for interpreting resistivity logs of wells in freshwater aquifers. To accomplish this, we use the simultaneous measurements of formation resistivity at two different values of salinity: the freshwater virgin zone obtained from a deep induction log or laterolog and the mud filtrate\\u2013invaded zone inferred from a short normal or microfocused log. It must be assumed that either the effective porosity or the cementation exponent, and the native water and mud filtrate resistivities are known from other sources.

It is probable that these schemes have had comparatively little actual application in the interpretation of magnetic and gravity surveys. This is because of the fact that unless certain controls other than the gravity and magnetic data are available the inherent ambiguities of the physically possible distributions of material which can produce the observed effects make an accurate calculation meaningless, even though the geophysical data may be of any desired precision.

Higher order residual moveouts require increasingly difficult scans of semblances with extra dimensions or picking from correlations with many local minima. Alternatively, we can model our data with an adaptive convolution that assumes consistent reflectivities at all offsets (or angles). Short, convolutional wavelets can adjust residual moveouts arbitrarily with offset, but slowly with time (or depth). A Gauss-Newton optimization easily inverts this transform by minimizing a least-squares objective function. With estimated and normalized wavelets, we deconvolved the original data to remove phase and spectral distortions that affected more than one reflection. By constraining how slowly wavelets adapt, we retained phase and amplitude changes distinctive to individual reflections. Deconvolution also avoided any explicit smoothing or mixing of amplitudes among traces. Estimated wavelets captured residual coherence and were easier to track visually than individually weak reflections.

The nearly analytic discrete method (NADM) and its improved version, developed recently, can suppress numerical dispersion efficiently. However, the NADM is imperfect, especially in long-time seismic wave propagation simulation. To overcome this limitation, by minimizing the energy-error function, we have developed a modified optimal nearly analytical discretized (MNAD) method. The stencil of MNAD for the 2D wave equation is a novel diamond stencil. MNAD has two major advantages: The first one is that MNAD can suppress numerical dispersion effectively on coarse grids, which significantly improved computational efficiency and reduced memory demands. The second advantage is that the energy error of MNAD is much smaller after long-time simulation. The numerical dispersion analysis shows that the maximum phase velocity error was 5.92% even if only two sampling points were adopted in each minimum wavelength. To simulate a wavefield without visible numerical dispersion, the computational speed of MNAD, measured by CPU time, was approximately 4.32 times and 1.43 times comparing with the fourth-order Lax-Wendroff correction (LWC) method and the optimal nearly analytical discretized method (ONADM), respectively. MNAD also shows good numerical stability. Its CFL condition increased 24.3% comparing with that of ONADM, from 0.523 to 0.650. The total energy error was less than 1.5% after 300-s simulation whereas the error of other numerical schemes, such as the fourth-order and eighth-order LWC, etc., was up to more than 10% under the same computational parameters. Numerical results showed that our MNAD method performed well in computational efficiency, simulation accuracy, and numerical stability, as well as provided a useful tool for large-scale, long-time seismic wave propagation simulation.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'Laboratory physical modeling and laser-based experiments are frequently proposed to tackle theoretical and methodological issues related to seismic prospecting, e.g., when experimental validations of processing or inversion techniques are required. Lasers are mainly used to simulate typical field acquisition setups on homogeneous and consolidated materials assembled into laboratory-scale physical models (PMs) of various earth structures. We suggested the use of granular materials to study seismic-wave propagation in unconsolidated and porous media and target near-surface exploration and hydrogeologic applications. We designed and tested the reproducibility of an experimental procedure to build and probe PMs consisting of micrometric glass beads (GBs). A mechanical source and a laser-Doppler vibrometer were used to record small-scale seismic lines at the surface of three GBs models. When guided surface acoustic mode theory should prevail in such unconsolidated granular packed structure under gravity, we only considered elastic-wave propagation in stratified media to interpret recorded data. Thanks to basic seismic processing and inversion methods (first arrivals and dispersion analyses), we were able to correctly retrieve the gradients of pressure- and shear-wave velocities in our models. A 3D elastic finite difference simulation of the experiment offered, despite significant differences in terms of amplitudes, a supplementary validation of our approximation, as far as elastic properties of the medium were concerned.'],\n",

Our goal was to improve the computational efficiency of AWWE and to enhance the suppression of edge reflections by applying a convolutional PML (CPML). We reformulated the original AWWE as a first-order formulation and incorporated the CPML with a general complex frequency shifted stretching operator into the renewed formulation. A staggered-grid finite-difference (FD) method was adopted to discretize the first-order equation system. For wavefield depth continuation, the first-order AWWE with the CPML saved memory compared with the original second-order AWWE with the conventional split PML.

       " {u'abstract': [u'Conventional methods of prestack depth imaging aim at producing a structural image that delineates the interfaces of the geologic variations or the reflectivity of the earth. However, it is the underlying impedance and velocity changes that generate this reflectivity that are of more interest for characterizing the reservoir. Indeed, the need to generate a better product for geologic interpretation leads to the subsequent application of traditional seismic-inversion techniques to the reflectivity sections that come from typical depth-imaging processes. The drawback here is that these seismic-inversion techniques use additional information, e.g., from well logs or velocity models, to fill the low frequencies missing in traditional seismic data due to the free-surface ghost in marine acquisition. We found that with the help of broadband acquisition and processing techniques, the bandwidth gap between the depth-imaging world and seismic inversion world is reducing. We outlined a theory that shows how angle-domain common-image gathers produced by an amplitude-preserving reverse time migration can estimate impedance and velocity perturbations. The near-angle stacked image provides the impedance perturbation estimate whereas the far-angle image can be used to estimate the velocity perturbation. In the context of marine acquisition and exploration, our method can, together with a ghost compensation technique, be a useful tool for seismic inversion, and it is also adaptable to a full-waveform inversion framework.

       " {u'abstract': [u'Free-surface-related multiples are usually regarded as noise in conventional seismic processing. However, they can provide extra illumination of the subsurface and thus have been used in migration procedures, e.g., in one- and two-way wave-equation migrations. The disadvantage of the migration of multiples is the migration artifacts generated by the crosscorrelation of different seismic events, e.g., primaries and second-order free-surface-related multiples, so the effective elimination of migration artifacts is crucial for migration of multiples. The angle domain common image gather (ADCIG) is a suitable domain for testing the correctness of a migration velocity model. When the migration velocity model is correct, all the events in ADCIGs should be flat, and this provides a criterion for removing the migration artifacts. Our approach first obtains ADCIGs during reverse time migration and then applies a high-resolution parabolic Radon transform to all ADCIGs. By doing so, most migration artifacts will reside in the nonzero curvature regions in the Radon domain, and then a muting procedure can be implemented to remove the data components outside the vicinity of zero curvature. After the application of an adjoint Radon transform, the filtered ADCIGs are obtained and the final denoised migration result is generated by stacking all filtered ADCIGs. A three-flat-layer velocity model and the Marmousi synthetic data set are used for numerical experiments. The numerical results revealed that the proposed approach can eliminate most artifacts generated by migration of multiples when the migration velocity model is correct.'],\n",

Amplitude compensation based on source-side illumination ignores the aperture effects on the receiver side, and it may fail to recover the true-reflection/scattering strength of a geologic structure from the image. The structural dip largely controls if the wave incident on the structure can be reflected back and received by the acquisition aperture, so it should be taken into account in removing the acquisition effects from the migration image. We derived a dip-angle domain amplitude correctionfrom the resolution theory. The stacked migration image created by reverse time migration was decomposed into common dip images, which were compensated individually by the corresponding amplitude correction factor. Then, we summed up the corrected images to form a final image. To construct the amplitude correction factor, we generated a monofrequency Green\\u2019s function at the shot/geophone location and further decomposed it into incident/scattered plane waves. They were combined based on Snell\\u2019s law to construct correction factors for different dips.

Using a local passive surface seismic monitoring network of 15 broadband stations, we applied two modern location techniques that use fundamentally different approaches. The first is a pick-based double-difference relocation method with waveform crosscorrelation. Multiple-event location techniques such as these are generally regarded as the best approach for obtaining high-precision locations from pick data. The second approach is an automated waveform migration stacking method. These types of methods are becoming increasingly common due to increasing network station density and computer power. The results from the two methods show excellent agreement and provide similar results for the interpreter. Both methods reveal spatial and temporal patterns in the locations that are not visible in results obtained using a more traditional pick-based approach. We performed two statistical uncertainty tests to assess the effects of data quality and quantity on the two methods. We show that the uncertainties for both methods are comparable, but that the stack-based locations are less sensitive to station geometry, likely due to the different treatment of outliers and the beneficial inclusion of noisier data. Finally, we discuss the favorable conditions in which to apply each method and argue that for small aperture surface arrays where accurate velocity information exists, such as in this study, the stack-based method is preferable due to the higher degree of automation. Under these conditions, stack-based methods better allow for rapid and precise determination of microearthquake locations, facilitating improved interpretations of seismogenic processes.'],\n",

However, these estimates are unstable even in the presence of a weak amount of noise, and Euler deconvolution of noisy data leads to an underestimation of structural index and depth. We have studied how the structural index and depth estimates are affected by applying low-pass filtering to the data. Physically based low-pass filters, such as upward continuation and integration, have been shown to be the best choice over a range of altitudes (upward continuation) or orders (integration filters), mainly because their outputs have a well-defined physical meaning. In contrast, mathematical low-pass filters require that the filter parameters be tuned carefully by means of several trial tests to produce optimally smoothed fields. The C-norm criterion is a reliable strategy to produce a stabilized vertical derivative, and we discourage Butterworth filters because they tend to a vertical integral filter, for a high cutoff wavenumber, thus complicating the interpretation of the estimated structural index. We found that the estimated structural index and depth to source increase proportionally with the amount of smoothing, unless in the case of overfiltering. In that case, the severe distortion of the original field may cause a decrease of the estimated structural index and depth to source.'],\n",

We also determined that when water circulation encompasses a heterogeneity, the equivalence with single current poles is lost, and this can be used as a field criterion to detect inhomogeneities near a well.

Such unusual dispersion spectra were prevalent in the multichannel surface-wave data acquired from our permafrost study site at Barrow, Alaska. Owing to the difficulties in picking and identifying dispersion curves from these dispersion spectra, conventional surface-wave inversion methods become problematic to apply. To overcome these difficulties, we adopted a full-wavefield method to invert for velocity models that can best fit the dispersion spectra instead of the dispersion curves.

In contrast, the problem of the electromagnetic response of a confined resistor buried in a conductive host has been less thoroughly studied. However, resistive targets are important in geotechnical and hydrologic studies, archaeological prospecting, and, more recently, offshore hydrocarbon exploration. I analytically address the problem of the electromagnetic response of a completely resistive cylindrical cavity buried in a conductive host in the presence of a simplified 2D electric dipole source. In contrast to the confined conductor, which channels and induces current systems, the confined resistor deflects current and produces additional eddy current systems in the conductive host. I apply this theory to model the response of a grounded electric dipole-dipole system operating over a range of frequencies from 0\\xa0Hz to 10\\xa0kHz, in the presence of a horizontal 5-m radius insulating cylinder located 1-m beneath the surface of a uniform earth. This represents a common hazard encountered during mining and civil engineering operations. Results show that such an insulating cavity increases the recorded electric field amplitude and phase delay at all transmitted frequencies. These observations suggest that a broadband electromagnetic prospecting system may provide additional information about the location and extent of a void, over and above a standard dipole-dipole resistivity survey. When the host skin depth is much larger than all other length scales, the response can be approximated by an equivalent single dipole unless the cylinder\\u2019s radius is much larger than its distance from the transmitter.

To improve the ability of this method to produce images representative of the true subsurface structure, we require high spatial resolution.

Several studies have found that modeling the signal phase accurately and inverting a complex-valued NMR signal, can improve the spatial resolution of the surface NMR water content images. We propose alternative excitation schemes designed to generate a complex-valued signal, where the quadrature component can be controlled experimentally and was larger than that generated by the conductivity effects. This allowed a single excitation to provide two samplings of the subsurface properties, one stored in the real component and another in the quadrature component.

       " {u'abstract': [u'We have developed an efficient numerical scheme for fast multimodel 3D electromagnetic simulations by applying a Schur complement approach to a frequency-domain finite-difference method. The scheme is based on direct solvers and developed with constrained inversion algorithms in view. Such algorithms normally need many forward modeling jobs with different resistivities for the target zone and/or background formation. We geometrically divide the computational domain into two subdomains: an anomalous subdomain, the resistivities of which were permitted to change, and a background subdomain, having fixed resistivities. The system matrix is partially factorized by precomputing a Schur complement to eliminate unknowns associated with the background subdomain. The Schur complement system is then solved to compute fields inside the anomalous subdomain. Finally, the background subdomain fields are computed using inexpensive local substitutions. For each successive simulation, only the relatively small Schur complement system has to be solved, which results in significant computational savings. We applied this approach to two moderately sized 3D problems in marine controlled-source electromagnetic modeling: (1)\\xa0a deepwater model in which the resistivities of the seawater and the air layer were kept fixed and (2)\\xa0a model in which focused inversion was performed in a scenario in which the resistivities of the background formation, the air layer, and the seawater were known. We found a significant reduction of the modeling time in inversion that depended on the relative sizes of the constrained and unconstrained volumes: the smaller the unconstrained volume, the larger the savings. Specifically, for a focused inversion of the Troll oil field in the North Sea, the gain amounted up to 80% of the total modeling time.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'Understanding the effects of induced-polarization (IP) effects on time-domain electromagnetic data requires the ability to simulate common survey techniques when taking chargeability into account. Most existing techniques preform this modeling in the frequency domain prior to transforming their results to the time domain. Even though this technique can allow for chargeable material to be easily incorporated, its application for some problems can be computationally limiting. We developed a new technique for forward modeling the time-domain electromagnetic response of chargeable materials in three dimensions. The frequency dependence of Ohms\\u2019 law translates to an ordinary differential equation when considered in the time domain. The system of ordinary-partial differential equations was then discretized using an implicit time-stepping algorithm, that yielded absolute stability. This approach allowed us to operate directly in the time domain and avoid frequency to time-domain transformations. Although this approach can be applied directly to materials exhibiting Debye dispersions, other Cole-Cole dispersions resulted in fractional derivatives in time. To overcome this difficulty, Pad\\xe9 approximations were used to represent the frequency dependence as a rational series of integer order terms. The resulting method was then simplified to generate a reduced time-domain model that can be used to forward model the IP decay curves in the absence of any electromagnetic coupling. We found numerical examples in which the method produced accurate results. The potential application of the method was demonstrated by modeling the full time-domain electromagnetic response of a gradient array IP survey, and the occurrence of negative transients in airborne time-domain electromagnetic data.'],\n",

The azimuth of a geologic structure, however, cannot be uniquely determined with acoustic signals recorded in the borehole alone, due to the azimuth ambiguity existing in current imaging techniques. We eliminated such ambiguity by revealing the relevant acoustic principle underlying the P-wave reflection behavior. When a P-wave excited by a transducer in the logging tool impinges upon a planar interface, the P-wave reflection coefficient (RC) of the displacement is opposite in sign to that of the normal stress or fluid pressure, regardless of the incident angle and the parameters of the media on the two sides. The derived relation about signs of RCs was validated by finite-difference solutions for reflected waves from a near-borehole plane fault. With this newly discovered reflection principle, one can eliminate the azimuth ambiguity of any interface outside a borehole by checking if the waveforms of pressure and the displacement component are both changed in polarity after reflection. Furthermore, because the pressure and displacement are observable quantities and the waveform of the acoustic source is known in acoustic logging, it is convenient to implement the data acquisition for this technique, which is a major advantage over other techniques.

The change in the S-wave velocity or shear modulus upon fluid substitution can be predicted with Gassmann\\u2019s equations starting only with the initial S-wave velocity. However, predicting changes in P-wave velocity or the P-wave modulus requires knowledge of the initial P- and S-wave velocities. We initiated a rigorous derivation of the P-wave modulus for fluid and solid substitution in monomineralic isotropic rocks for cases in which an estimate of the S-wave velocity or shear modulus is not available. For the general case of solid substitution, the exact equation for the P-wave modulus depends on parameters that are usually unknown. However, for fluid substitution, fewer parameters are required. As Poisson\\u2019s ratio increases for the mineral in the rock frame, the dependence of exact substitution on these unknown parameters decreases. As a result, in the absence of shear velocity, P-wave modulus fluid substitution can, for example, be performed with higher confidence for rocks with a calcite or dolomite frame than it can for rocks with quartz frame. We evaluated a recipe for applying the new P-wave modulus fluid substitution. This improves on existing work and is recommended for practice.'],\n",

This approach was found to perform much better in the complex stress environment, providing more stable calibration behavior and more reliably extrapolating to stress states beyond those present in the calibration data. Although vertical and mean stress compaction models may work well in simple stress environments, we discovered that incorporation of shear stress is necessary for models in complex stress settings. Although the addition of shear stress significantly improves agreement with field data, it also increases the complexity of the model as well as the requirements for calibration data. We therefore evaluated the settings in which each of these three approaches \\u2014 vertical stress, mean stress, and SBS \\u2014 may be most appropriate.'],\n",

For water management, it would be beneficial to understand the rates at which collapse conduits recharge an underlying aquifer. Self-potential (SP) monitoring has promise as a noninvasive, relatively low-cost method for assessing temporal variability in flow. Previous studies suggested that negative SP anomalies over collapse conduits correspond to downward-flowing groundwater; however, before SP surveys can be reliable indicators of conduit flow, SP from ET, soil conductivity changes, redox, electrode effects, and cultural noise must be better understood. A year of continuous SP monitoring with two grids of approximately 15 Pb/PbCl/KCl nonpolarizing electrodes each was combined with high-resolution ground-penetrating radar surveys and intermittent water table monitoring over two small covered-karst conduits in Tampa, Florida, USA. Although variations in SP resulting from changes in cultural noise, soil conductivity, ET, redox, and rainfall were evident, separate and unrelated positive and negative SP anomalies episodically manifested over conduits, which suggested that conduit flow could be dynamic, not static. Three flow regimes in conduits were postulated: conduit permeability higher than in surrounding surficial sediments, conduit permeability lower than in surrounding surface sediments, conduit permeability matched surrounding surface sediments. Numerical steady-state 2D simulations in Comsol created the three postulated flow regimes and revealed that a different SP polarity could result from different rates of flow: positive SP corresponded to higher permeability conduits, negative SP corresponded to lower permeability conduits, no or minimal SP appeared when conduits and surrounding sediments had equal permeability. In these models, downward flow was not responsible for generating negative SP. To assess the hydrology of a conduit, it appears that SP should be monitored continuously. Further monitoring of field sites with hydrologic sensors is needed.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'Anelliptic approximations for phase and group velocities of qP waves in transversely isotropic (TI) media have been widely applied in various seismic data processing and imaging tasks. We have revisited previously proposed approximations and suggested two improvements. The first improvement involves finding an empirical connection between anelliptic parameters along different fitting axes based on laboratory measurements of anisotropy of rock samples of different types. The relationship between anelliptic parameters observed was strongly linear suggesting a novel set of anisotropic parameters suitable for the study of qP-wave signatures. The second improvement involves suggesting a new functional form for the anelliptic parameter term to achieve better fitting along the horizontal axis. These modifications led to improved three-parameter and four-parameter approximations for phase and group velocities of qP-waves in TI media. In several model comparisons, the new three-parameter approximations appeared to be more accurate than previous approximations with the same number of parameters. These modifications also served as a foundation for an extension to orthorhombic media, where qP velocities involved nine independent elastic parameters. As determined by previous researchers, qP-wave propagation in orthorhombic media could be adequately approximated using just six combinations of those nine parameters. We have developed novel six-parameter approximations for phase and group velocities for qP-waves in orthorhombic media. The orthorhombic phase-velocity approximation provides a more accurate alternative to previously known approximations and can find applications in full-wave modeling, imaging, and inversion. The group-velocity approximation is also highly accurate and can find applications in ray tracing and velocity analysis.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'Finite-difference methods are popular for wave simulation within the seismic exploration community, thanks to their efficiency. However, difficulties arise when encountering complex topography due to the regular grid pattern of the finite-difference schemes. Despite alternatives that can handle the free surface with little effort, such as the spectral element or discontinuous Galerkin\\u2019s methods, incorporating a free-surface boundary condition within the finite-difference framework is still appealing, even at the cost of extra algorithm complexity and stronger requirement of computational resources. We present a free-surface boundary treatment within the finite-difference framework, belonging to the family of the immersed-boundary methods. Inherently, the presented boundary treatment is separated from the rest of the wave simulation, which makes it easy to be integrated in existing finite-difference codes. Specifically, we construct an extrapolation operator for each grid point above the free surface, if requested by the finite-difference stencil, to estimate its fictitious wavefield value at each time step. These operators are constructed only once and remain unchanged for all the time steps and source locations. The memory requirement of these operators is significant. Fortunately, grouping together multiple simulations concerning different source locations makes it possible to dilute the memory burden to a negligible level. Additionally, applying these operators incurs numerical noise, which may lead to long time instabilities. In such a scenario, additional numerical procedures, for instance, introducing artificial diffusion, are necessary to control the instability and obtain sensible simulation results. Successful applications of the presented boundary treatment to elastic-wave equations on domains with nontrivial topographies, in 2D and 3D, are presented. Robust and efficient numerical techniques to control high-frequency numerical noise remain to be investigated.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'We developed a new partial common-reflection-surface (CRS) stacking method to enhance the quality of sparse low-fold seismic data. For this purpose, we use kinematic wavefield attributes computed during the automatic CRS stack. We apply a multiparameter CRS traveltime formula to compute partial stacked CRS supergathers. Our algorithm allows us to generate NMO-uncorrected gathers without the application of inverse NMO/DMO. Gathers obtained by this approach are regularized and have better signal-to-noise ratio compared with original common-midpoint gathers. Instead of the original data, these improved prestack data can be used in many conventional processing steps, e.g., velocity analysis or prestack depth migration, providing enhanced images and better quality control. We verified the method on 2D synthetic data and applied it to low-fold land data from northern Germany. The synthetic examples show the robustness of the partial CRS stack in the presence of noise. Sparse land data became regularized, and the signal-to-noise ratio of the seismograms increased as a result of the partial CRS stack. Prestack depth migration of the generated partially stacked CRS supergathers produced significantly improved common-image gathers as well as depth-migrated sections.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'We have developed an interferometric interpolation method for filling in trace gaps in common-shot gathers. There are two steps for implementation. First, virtual traces are created in the trace gaps by crosscorrelating recorded traces in a shot gather followed by summing correlated trace pairs over all shot positions. Second, a 1D matching filter is applied to the predicted events to correct for wavelet and amplitude distortions. By using a 1D assumption (assuming a layered medium around the midpoint in a common-midpoint (CMP) gather), the interferometric interpolation method can be applied to CMP gathers. It is a fully data-driven method that requires only the original data. Results with synthetic and field data empirically show that the near-offset traces can be interpolated; but because of the approximations introduced by a limited recording aperture, there are still some artifacts. For comparison, a 2D nonstationary prediction-error filter (PEF) was also used instead of a 1D matching filter in the second step of the interferometric interpolation method. The comparison between the 1D matching filter results and 2D PEF results does not show significant differences.'],\n",

The canonical examples of tilted-Cartesian, polar, and elliptical coordinates can be used to illustrate the ADCIG theory. I have compared analytically and numerically generated image volumes for a set of elliptically shaped reflectors.

To deal with this problem, we invert magnetic data for a three-component subsurface magnetization vector, as opposed to magnetic susceptibility (a scalar). The magnetization vector can be cast in a Cartesian or spherical framework. In the Cartesian formulation, the total magnetization is split into one component parallel and two components perpendicular to the earth\\u2019s field. In the spherical formulation, we invert for magnetization amplitude and the dip and azimuth of the magnetization direction. Our inversion schemes contain flexibility to obtain different types of magnetization models and allow for inclusion of geologic information regarding remanence. Allowing a vector magnetization increases the nonuniqueness of the magnetic inverse problem greatly, but additional information (e.g., knowledge of physical properties or geology) incorporated as constraints can improve the results dramatically. Commonly available information results in complicated nonlinear constraints in the Cartesian formulation. However, moving to a spherical formulation results in simple bound constraints at the expense of a now nonlinear objective function. We test our methods using synthetic and real data from scenarios involving complicated remanence (i.e., many magnetized bodies with many magnetization directions).

GPR methods that focus on changes in waveform or polarization can improve detection and discrimination of fractures within rock bodies. An algorithm based on coherency, a seismic attribute that delineates discontinuities in wavelet shape, is developed for polarimetric GPR. It uses the largest eigenvalue of the time-domain scattering matrix when calculating coherence. This algorithm is sensitive to wave shape and is unbiased by the polarization of GPR antennas. Polarimetric coherency works better than scalar coherency in removing the effects of polarization on field data collected from a fractured limestone plot used for hydrologic experimentation. Another method, for time-domain full-waveform inversion of transmission data, quantitatively determines fracture aperture and EM properties of fill, based on a thin-layer model. Inversion results from field data show consistency with the location of fractures from reflection data. These two methods offer better fracture-detection capability and quantitative information on fracture aperture, dielectric permittivity, and electrical conductivity of the fill than traditional GPR imaging and scalar-coherency attributes.'],\n",

Step one optimizes geometric transformations performed on different convex polygons. This step provides approximate size and location data.

The interpretation model consists of a grid of 3D vertical, juxtaposed prisms in the horizontal and vertical directions. Iteratively, our approach estimates the 3D density-contrast distribution that fits the observed anomaly within the measurement errors and favors compact gravity sources closest to prespecified geometric elements such as axes and points. This method retrieves the geometry of multiple gravity sources whose density contrasts (positive and negative values) are prescribed by the interpreter through the geometric element. At the first iteration, we set an initial interpretation model and specify the first-guess geometric elements and their target density contrasts. Each geometric element operates as the first-guess skeletal outline of the entire homogeneous gravity source or any of its homogeneous parts to be reconstructed. From the second iteration on, our method automatically redefines a new set of geometric elements, the associated target density contrasts, and a new interpretation model whose number of prisms increases with the iteration. The iteration stops when the geometries of the estimated sources are invariant along successive iterations.

       " {u'abstract': [u'A sonic measurements-while-drilling tool consists of acoustic transmitters and receivers mounted on a drill collar that has the form of a thick steel pipe. This mandrel is designed to meet the strength requirements of tough logging conditions encountered in deviated and horizontal drilling. A primary goal of sonic measurement is to estimate formation compressional and shear slownesses that are not affected by the presence of a drill collar. Understanding the basic physics of monopole, flexural, and quadrupole modes in a cylindrically layered structure consisting of a concentric steel pipe in a water-filled borehole can help in estimating formation compressional and shear slownesses from at least one branch, either of the monopole, dipole, or quadrupole family of modes. Results show that coupling between the pipe and formation modes is strongly dependent on formation properties relative to the borehole-fluid compressional slowness. Thepresence of a steel pipe tool in a borehole causes a significant increase in the Stoneley dispersion at low frequencies. However, the Stoneley slownesses at high frequencies remain essentially the same as those in the open hole without a mandrel. The leaky compressional dispersion in slow formations produced by a monopole source also is perturbed at frequencies where the open-hole leaky compressional and Stoneley-wave dispersions are close to each other. Although there is a strong interference between the pipe and formation flexural modes in fast formations, such interference in slow formations occurs at very low frequencies, and the formation flexural dispersion is less affected by the presence of a drill collar at higher frequencies. Interestingly, the presence of a drill collar in a borehole causes rather small changes in the lowest-order quadrupole dispersion from the case of an open hole without a mandrel. Consequently, quadrupole logging is a preferred choice for estimating the formation shear slowness.'],\n",

It recognizes the dominant role of the anisotropic elastic properties of compacted clay in the anisotropic elasticity of shale at different length scales compared to contributions of shape and orientation of particles. Following a thorough validation at multiple length scales using mineral elasticity data, nanoindentation experiment results, and ultrasonic pulse velocity tests, the model predictions compare adequately with measurements on kerogen-free and kerogen-rich shales and shaley sandstones. The acoustic signature of shale thus is found to be controlled by two volumetric parameters that synthesize the porosity and mineralogy information: the clay-packing density and the silt inclusion volume fraction. Through a series of dimensionless isoparametric plots, the micromechanics model predicts trends of increasing elastic anisotropy with increasing clay-packing density (or decreasing porosity), which correspond to the intrinsic mechanical response of unfractured shale, and quantifies the stiffness reduction induced by the presence of kerogen.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'A simple method to deal with cracklike pores in anisotropic matrix rock such as shales enhances analytical models and their applications. Actually, clayrocks (shales, in particular) are the dominant clastic component in sedimentary basins, representing about two-thirds of all sedimentary rocks. Shales are usually assumed to be transversely isotropic (TI) media. They are known to be highly anisotropic because of (1) intrinsic elastic anisotropy of the solid phase (matrix) forming the rock (more or less ordered clay layers) and (2) anisotropy induced by the presence of cracklike pores. We focus on this second component of anisotropy. Current analytical models deal with it, but they are complex and are restricted in the case of matrix TI symmetry to cracks lying in the symmetry plane. We simplify such models within a reasonably good approximation and develop an analysis scheme in which cracklike pore effects are calculated in an equivalent isotropic matrix. This simplifies the theoretical approach and potentially broadens its application to any crack and/or pore orientation, e.g., damaged shale with horizontal and vertical (perpendicular to the bedding plane) cracks. A high-pressure confinement test provides experimental data for checking the proposed tool against a reference model in the case of cracklike pores lying in the bedding plane. The results (in terms of Thomsen parameters) are consistent with results from large-scale field data.'],\n",

We found a clear relationship between the mixing parameter and correlation lengths of the facies distributions with respect to horizontal and vertical directions. Then, we used the power-law mixing model to invert for individual Cole-Cole model parameters by fitting predicted electrical responses to simulated spectral effective complex-resistivity data for the two perpendicular directions.

In particular, the wavelet transform modulus maxima (WTMM) spectra, obtained by following the local extrema of wavelet transforms along a constant phase line, describe characteristics of discontinuities such as interfaces. They also show a smooth behavior as a function of scale and thus allow us to derive local scaling laws. We use scaling behavior of WTMM spectra to enhance the bandwidth of seismic data. An analysis of well-log scaling behaviors and the seismic data shows that, whereas the WTMM spectrum of well logs at each interface exhibits a power-law behavior as a function of scale, the corresponding seismic signal spectrum shows a more complicated behavior, arising from seismic wavelet effects. Under the assumption that local well-log power-law behavior holds in general, a scaling law for seismic signals can be derived in terms of parameters that describe subsurface scaling effects and the seismic wavelet. A stable estimation of these parameters can be carried out simultaneously, as a function of time and over the seismic bandwidth, using the modified scaling law. No well-log information is needed to derive the seismic wavelet. Then wavelet transforms can be corrected for seismic wavelet effects and a high-resolution signal reconstructed. This reconstructed high-resolution signal can be used to map features that might not be obvious in the original seismic data, such as small faults, fractures, and fine-scale variations within channel margins.'],\n",

For fixed-window transforms, we use the short-time Fourier transform and Gabor transform. The S-transform and continuous wavelet transform are analyzed as the variable-length transforms. First we conduct a synthetic transmission experiment, and compare the frequency-dependent scattering attenuation to the theoretically predicted values.

We conclude that time-frequency transforms with a systematically varying time window, such as the S-transform and continuous wavelet transform, allow for more robust estimates of seismic attenuation.

The results support the assumption that the difference between static and dynamic moduli can be ascribed to the difference in strain amplitude between static and dynamic measurements.

Essentially, this study corrects an inconsistency or error related to fluid-mass conservation in an existing expression for the t-matrix (wave-induced deformation) of a communicating cavity, a cavity that is isolated with respect to stress propagation (through the solid matrix) but that can exchange fluid mass with other cavities because of global and/or local pressure gradients associated with passage of a long viscoelastic wave. An earlier demonstration of Gassmann consistency remains valid because the new theory of global flow and squirt flow (which also takes into account solid mechanical effects of stress interaction by us-ing products of communicating t-matrices associated with two-point correlation functions of ellipsoidal symmetry) only differs from an earlier version by a correction term that goes to zero in the low-frequency limit. If the unified model is applied to the special case of a model involving a single set of spheroidal cavities (having the same aspect ratio and orientation), the results become identical with those obtained using a special theory of global flow that predicts that at zero frequency the cavities will behave as though they are isolated with respect to wave-induced fluid flow (in accordance with Gassmann\\u2019s formulas) and that at high frequencies, they will behave as though they are dry. Our theory predicts that there will be a continuous transition from a global-flow-dominated system (characterized by a negative velocity dispersion) to a squirt-flow-dominated system (characterized by a positive velocity dispersion) if one begins with a single set of cavities and then introduces a distribution of shapes and/or orientations that gradually becomes wider (more realistic).'],\n",

Maps of the continuous variation of the percentage of gas saturation are computed and associated binary maps obtained through a global thresholding technique.

Successive merging of thinner beds with thicker beds results in clear differences in average rock properties between the lithostratigraphic units, but there is insufficient variation about the averages to preclude statistically significant differentiation of the sandstones. Lithostratigraphic unit properties also vary laterally. At the architectural element scale, two architectural elements are channel element and lobe element. Only wellbore acoustic impedance differs significantly between these two elements. However, the internal lateral architecture of these two elements is quite different. The results highlight the difficulty in evaluating stratigraphic patterns away from the wellbore. More research in this area is warranted. Attempts to quantify lateral variability of properties in a geologically realistic manner are encouraged because lateral variability is as important to reservoir characterization and performance as is vertical variability.'],\n",

Based on a standard fractional approximation, a new parameterization in slowness-squared parameters provides optimal sampling of the NMO velocity and anellipticity. The automatic nonhyperbolic velocity analysis is performed with a normalized bootstrapped differential semblance (BDS) coherency estimator that leads to enhanced resolution in velocity spectra compared to differential semblance. Reflection wavelet centering inside time gates results in improved estimates of the two-way time and reduced bias in estimates of the NMO velocity and anellipticity. Generalized Dix equations give estimates of apparent interval thickness, velocity and anellipticity. The interval parameters will fit a homogeneous transversely isotropic medium with a vertical symmetry axis (a VTI medium) or an isotropic layer with a linear velocity gradient. The algorithm is implemented in a two-step strategy. A coarse hyperbolic velocity analysis that identifies events in the gather and estimates a velocity law for applying thetruncation is followed by a dense nonhyperbolic search to infer the physical parameters required for time processing of PP-wave data. The algorithm outputs an automatic stack and later-ally varying moveout velocity and anellipticity maps that can be used for subsequent time processing. Two attribute maps, the BDS map and its derivative, are also computed. These contain the fingerprints of the key reflectors and can be used in structural interpretation. Automatic nonhyperbolic velocity analysis is tested on a synthetic gather and a real data set from the North Sea. Nonhyperbolic parameter search shows an en-hanced estimate of the processing parameters, velocity and anellipticity, and improved quality of the stacked section com-pared with the result from hyperbolic search. The interval moveout velocity maps demonstrate a good match with the reflector positions in the obtained sections and show a great correlation when compared with the results of more advanced processing. The interval anellipticity map is also important for enhanced time processing and resolving the time-depth conversion problem, but the parameter is meaningless when the anisotropy is important or when the aperture is small, mainly for deep reflectors.'],\n",

These oscillations consist of surface types of circumferential waves that repeatedly propagate around the object. The resonant emission of such trapped energy occurs primarily in the form of shear body waves that can be detected by remotely placed receivers. Resonant emission reveals itself in the form of sharp resonant peaks for the late parts of the records, when all strong direct and primary reflected waves are gone. These peaks were observed in field data for a buried barrel filled with water, in 2D finite-difference modeling results, and in the exact canonical solution for a fluid-filled sphere. A computed animation for the diffraction of a plane wave upon a low-velocity elastic sphere confirms the generation of resonances by durable surface waves. Resonant emission has characteristic quasi-hyperbolic traveltime patterns on shot gathers. The inversion of these patterns can be performed in the frequency domain after muting the strong direct and primary scattered waves.

We focus on the amplitudes and kinematics of VS data, generated by an array of active sources at the surface and recorded by an array of receivers in a borehole. The quality of the VS data depends on the radiation pattern of the virtual source, which in turn is controlled by the spatial aperture of the surface source distribution. Theory suggests that when the receivers are surrounded by multi-component sources completely filling a closed surface, then the virtual source has an isotropic radiation pattern and VS data possess true amplitudes. In practical applications, limited sourceaperture and deployment of a single source type create an anisotropic radiation pattern of the virtual source, leading to distorted amplitudes. This pattern can be estimated by autocorrelating the spatial Fourier transform of the downgoing wavefield in the special case of a laterally invariant medium. The VS data can be improved by deconvolving the VS data with the estimated amplitude radiation pattern in the frequency-wavenumber domain. This operation alters the amplitude spectrum but not the phase of the data. We can also steer the virtual source by assigning it a new desired amplitude radiation pattern, given sufficient illumination exists in the desired directions. Alternatively, time-gating the downgoing wavefield before crosscorrelation, already common practice in implementing the VS method, can improve the radiation characteristics of a virtual source.'],\n",

We compared shot-profile migration using explicit migration operators with conventional Kirchhoff migration, split-step Fourier migration, and common-azimuth by generalized screen propagator (GSP) migration in terms of quality and computational cost. Image quality produced by the explicit migration operator approach is slightly better than with split-step Fourier migration and clearly better than in common-azimuth by GSP and Kirchhoff migrations. The main differences are fewer artifacts and better-suppressed noise within the salt bodies. Kirchhoff migration shows considerable artifacts (migration smiles) within and close to the salt bodies, which are not present in images produced by the other three wave-equation methods. Expressions for computational cost were developed for all four migration algorithms in terms of frequency content and acquisition parameters. For comparable frequency content, migration cost using explicit operators is four times the cost of the split-step Fourier method, up to 260 times the cost of common-azimuth by GSP migration, and 25 times the cost of Kirchhoff migration.

Also, they are not subject to the steep-dip limitations of many (so-called wave-equation) methods that use a one-way wave equation in depth to downward-continue wavefields. Previous presentations of Gaussian-beam migration have emphasized its kinematic imaging capabilities without addressing its amplitude fidelity. We offer two true-amplitude versions of Gaussian-beam migration. The first version combines aspects of the classic derivation of prestack Gaussian-beam migration with recent results on true-amplitude wave-equation migration, yields an expression involving a crosscorrelation imaging condition. To provide amplitude-versus-angle (AVA) information, true-amplitude wave-equation migration requires postmigration mapping from lateral distance (between image location and source location) to subsurface opening angle. However, Gaussian-beam migration does not require postmigration mapping to provide AVA data. Instead, the amplitudes and directions of the Gaussian beams provide information that the migration can use to produce AVA gathers as part of the migration process. The second version of true-amplitude Gaussian-beam migration is an expression involving a deconvolution imaging condition, yielding amplitude-variation-with-offset (AVO) information on migrated shot-domain common-image gathers.'],\n",

A Gauss-Newton minimization approach achieves a high convergence rate and an accurate reconstructed velocity image. By introducing a modified adjoint formulation, we can calculate the Jacobian matrix efficiently, allowing the material properties in the perfectly matched layers (PMLs) to be updated automatically during the inversion process.

This explanation differs from most previous work, which has focused on streamer oscillations, bulge waves inside old fluid-filled seismic streamers, or strumming/tugging as the main source of weather-related noise. Although modern streamers are less sensitive to such sources of noise, their ability to tackle the influence on turbulent flow noise has not improved. This implies that noise induced by turbulent flow has increased its relative impact on modern equipment.

We rederived the theory with sufficient generality to include converted waves explicitly. Generalization of the theory requires that the inherent converted-wave properties of mode change and finite scattering angle be accommodated. The significance of amplitude fidelity in modern seismic applications also affects the resolution description. We considered resolution in the context of a single recorded trace (trace resolution) and an image derived from many traces (image resolution). Trace resolution is governed by wavelet width, which results in a minimum bandwidth requirement, depending on scattering angle and local propagation velocities of incident and scattered modes. Image resolution is governed additionally by the migration acceptance angle and results in minimum aperture and sampling requirements. The requirements for converted-wave surveys generally differ from those of P- and S-wave surveys.

We combine this diverse information in a unified inverse-problem formulation using a multiproperty, multiscale model, linking properties statistically by petrophysical relationships and conditioning them to well-log data. Two approaches help us: (1) Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling, which generates many reservoir realizations for estimating medium properties and posterior marginal probabilities, and (2) optimization with a least-squares iterative technique to obtain the most probable model configuration. Our petrophysical model, applied to near-vertical-anglestackedseismic data and well-log data from a gas reservoir, includes a deterministic component, based on a combination of Wyllie and Wood relationships calibrated with the well-log data, and a random component, based on the statistical characterization of the deviations of well-log data from the petrophysical transform. At the petrophysical level, the effects of porosity and saturation on acoustic impedance are coupled; conditioning the inversion to well-log data helps resolve this ambiguity. The combination of well logs, petrophysics, and seismic inversion builds on the corresponding strengths of each type of information, jointly improving (1) cross resolution of reservoir properties, (2) vertical resolution of property fields, (3) compliance to the smooth trend of property fields, and (4) agreement with well-log data at well positions.'],\n",

The ability to image rock conditions \\u2014 stress and degree of fracturing \\u2014 ahead of the face gives the miners the ability to respond proactively to such problems. This method uses the energy from mining machinery, in this case a coal shearer, to produce an image of the rock velocity ahead of the mining face without interrupting mining. Data from an experiment illustrates the concept. Geophones installed in gate-road roofs record the noise generated by the shearer after it has traversed the panel ahead of the mining face. A generalized crosscorrelation of the signals from pairs of sensors determines relative arrival times from the continuous seismic noise produced by the shearer. These relative times can then be inverted for a velocity structure. The crosscorrelations, performed in the frequency domain, are weighted by a confidence value derived from the spectral coherence between the traces. This produces stable crosscorrelation lags in the presence of noise. The errors in the time-domain data are propagated through to the relative traveltimes and then to the final tomographic velocity image, yielding an estimate of the uncertainty in velocity at each point. This velocity image can then be used to infer information about the stress and fracture state of the rock, providing advance warning of potentially hazardous zones.'],\n",

Historically, LIs have been derived for 2D mass bodies of depth-dependent density contrast. I derive LIs for 2D mass bodies with density contrast dependent on (1) horizontal and (2) horizontal and vertical directions. Assuming the density contrast depends only on horizontal position, two types of representative LIs are derived: LIs with logarithmic kernel and density-integrated LIs for any integrable density-contrast function. A general density-contrast model that depends on horizontal and vertical directions is developed to include three components: a function of horizontal position, a function of vertical position, and a sum of crossterms of horizontal and vertical positions. Based on the general density-contrast model defined and proper selection of 2D vector gravity potentials, general LIs are derived to calculate the gravity anomaly. The newly developed LI method is then compared with two cases from the literature in calculating gravity anomaly, and agreement is obtained. However, the new LI method allows for more general 2D density-contrast variations and can be used to calculate the gravity anomaly of a 2D mass body. Such a mass body can have any cross-sectional profile that can be approximated by a polygonal cross section with any density-contrast function that can be approximated by a rich set of basis functions.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'I propose a method for derivative approximation, virtually unknown in the geophysical literature but is rapidly gaining recognition in other areas of computational science. The technique, called the complex-step derivative (CSD), is based on the theory of complex variables and approximates first-order derivatives of real-valued functions that are analytic in the complex plane. I extend the CSD technique to second-order derivatives, while preserving the robustness of the first-order formula. Thus the formulas together provide a complete differentiation system (referred to as semiautomatic differentiation, or SD) that allows efficient and accurate approximation of gradients, Jacobians and Hessians, as well as 2D and 3D partial and cross-partial spatial derivatives. Performance evaluation tests indicate that in comparison with ordinary finite-difference schemes (FD), the SD scheme is six to eight orders of magnitude more accurate, numerically highly stable, and step-size insensitive, which are major advantages over FD. The method shares with FD its attractive feature of ease of implementation. The SD scheme is implemented in a MATLAB toolkit. The validity of the CSD method depends critically on the requirement that the target function of differentiation be analytic in the complex plane. Therefore, prior to using the CSD method, one must ensure that all functions in the complex library are defined so that they satisfy this requirement. Specialized complex-function libraries that resolve this and other technical issues for CSD applications are available in the public domain.'],\n",

We examine the applicability of the marine controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) method to the reservoir-monitoring problem by analyzing representative 2D models. These studies show that CSEM responses exhibit small but measureable changes that are characteristic of reservoir-depletion geometry, with lateral flooding producing a concave-up depletion-anomaly curve and bottom flooding producing a concave-down depletion-anomaly curve. Lateral flooding is also revealed by the spatial-temporal variation of the CSEM anomaly, where the edge of the response anomaly closely tracks the retreating edge of the flooding reservoir. Measureable changes in CSEM responses are observed when 10% of the resistive reservoir is replaced by conductive pore fluids. However, to avoid corrupting the relatively small signal changes associated with depletion, the acquisition geometry must be maintained to a fraction of a percent accuracy. Additional factors, such as unknown nearby seafloor inhomogeneities and variable seawater conductivity, can mask depletion anomalies if not accounted for during repeat monitoring measurements. Although addressing these factors may be challenging using current exploration CSEM practices, straightforward solutions such as permanent monuments for seafloor receivers and transmitters are available and suggest the method could be utilized with present-day technology.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'One of the major problems in subsurface seismic exploration is the uncertainty (nonuniqueness) in geologic interpretation because of the complexity of subsurface geology and the limited dimension of the data available. Case studies from worldwide exploration projects indicate that an integrated, three-dimensional (3D) seismic volume visualization and interpretation workflow contributes to resolving the problem by mining and exposing critical geologic information from within seismic data volumes. Following 3D seismic data acquisition and processing, the interpretation workflow consists of four integrated phases from data selection and conditioning, to structure and facies characterization, to prospect evaluation and generation, to well-bore planning. In the data selection and conditioning phase, the most favored and frequently used data are the full-angle, limited-angle, and limited-azimuth stack amplitude with significant structure and facies enhancements. Signal-to-noise ratio, color scheme, dynamic range, bit resolution, and visual contrast all affect thevisibility of features of interest. In the structure and facies characterization phase, vertical slicing along arbitrary traverses demonstrates structure styles, stratigraphic architecture, and reservoir geometry in the cross-sectional view. Time/depth slicing defines lateral and vertical variability in the structural trend and areal extent in the map view. Stratal slicing and fault slicing map chronostratigraphic seismic facies and cross-stratal, along-fault seismic signature. Volume flattening and structure restoration aid in unraveling paleostructural framework and stratigraphic architecture and their growth histories. In the prospect evaluation and generation phase, a combination of volume trimming, co-rendering, transparency, attribute analysis, and attribute-body detection is instrumental in delineating volumetric extent and evaluating spatial connectivity of critical seismic features. Finally, in the well-bore planning phase, informed decision-making relies on the integration of all the information and knowledge interrogated from 3D seismic data. Most importantly, interpreters\\u2019 geologic insight and play concept are crucial to optimal well-bore planning with high geologic potential and low economic risk.'],\n",

It combines the advantages of two current adaptive multiple subtraction methods: the independent component analysis method and the multidimensional prediction error filters (PEF) method.

The maximum vertical extent might be larger than the seismic wavelengths for subcritical incidence angles close to the critical angle and for a strong impedance contrast at the interface. Although the part of the reflector volume lying below the interface and affecting traveltime measurements actually is smaller than described in previous studies, the whole part of the reflector volume that affects the amplitude of the reflected wavefield is larger than estimates in previous studies, which considered only the spatial region below the interface.

       " {u'abstract': [u'In seismic exploration a complex overburden can cause defocused and distorted seismic images of deeper target areas. While in surface seismic imaging it is difficult to overcome this problem, vertical seismic profile (VSP) borehole seismic imaging with its well-oriented recording geometry has proven able to circumvent the overburden\\u2019s detrimental impact. Recently, VSP near-wellbore salt flank imaging without knowledge of the overburden has shown encouraging results. In this paper, we introduce another method for a more common imaging purpose: imaging near-wellbore horizons without knowledge of the overburden. A key component of our method is a reverse ray-tracing technique that uses actual VSP direct-wave traveltime picks and extrapolates through a local velocity model to obtain the direct-wave traveltimes in the vicinity of the well. The extrapolated traveltimes then serve as references for migration of the VSP reflected data from near-wellbore horizons. The merits of this method are that all source-side effects such as shot position and triggering time statics are avoided, and it can efficiently and robustly image the near-wellbore horizons because it does not need an estimated overburden velocity model prone to errors. However, the image is limited to a diamond-shaped area around the well whose size is proportional to the VSP array. A synthetic VSP experiment on the SEG/EAGE 2D overthrust model shows that this method, with a local (even an estimated 1D) velocity model, effectively images structural features, such as dip direction and discontinuities of the near-wellbore horizons.'],\n",

The approach benefits from the use of prestack depth migration in angle domain, which is recognized as the most artifact-free Kirchhoff-type migration.

Cluster analysis consists of a family of approaches that have significant potential for classifying seismic trace shapes into meaningful clusters. The clustering can be performed using a supervised process (assigning a pattern to a predefined cluster) or an unsupervised process (partitioning a collection of patterns into groups without predefined clusters). We evaluate and compare different unsupervised clustering algorithms (e.g., partition, hierarchical, probabilistic, and soft competitive models) for pattern recognition based entirely on the characteristics of the seismic response. From validation results on simple data sets, we demonstrate that a self-organizing maps algorithm implemented in a visual data-mining approach outperforms all other clustering algorithms for interpreting the cluster structure.

       " {u'abstract': [u'Different theoretical and laboratory studies on the propagation of elastic waves in real rocks have shown that the presence of heterogeneities larger than the pore size but smaller than the predominant wavelengths (mesoscopic-scale heterogeneities) may produce significant attenuation and velocity dispersion effects on seismic waves. Such phenomena are known as \\u201cmesoscopic effects\\u201d and are caused by equilibration of wave-induced fluid pressure gradients. We propose a numerical upscaling procedure to obtain equivalent viscoelastic solids for heterogeneous fluid-saturated rocks. It consists in simulating oscillatory compressibility and shear tests in the space-frequency domain, which enable us to obtain the equivalent complex undrained plane wave and shear moduli of the rock sample. We assume that the behavior of the porous media obeys Biot\\u2019s equations and use a finite-element procedure to approximate the solutions of the associated boundary value problems. Also, because at mesoscopic scales rock parameter distributions are generally uncertain and of stochastic nature, we propose applying the compressibility and shear tests in a Monte Carlo fashion. This facilitates the definition of average equivalent viscoelastic media by computing the moments of the equivalent phase velocities and inverse quality factors over a set of realizations of stochastic rock parameters described by a given spectral density distribution. We analyzed the sensitivity of the mesoscopic effects to different kinds of heterogeneities in the rock and fluid properties using numerical examples. Also, the application of the Monte Carlo procedure allowed us to determine the statistical properties of phase velocities and inverse quality factors for the particular case of quasi-fractal heterogeneities.'],\n",

The generated reflectivity amplitude variations with offset have been increasingly used in seismic interpretation and more recently tested on ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data to characterize nonaqueous-phase liquid contaminants. Phase and frequency sensitivities of the reflected signals are generally not used, although they contain useful information. The present study aims to evaluate the potential of these combined properties to characterize a thin bed using GPR data acquired along a common-midpoint (CMP) survey, carried out to assess velocity variations in the ground. It has been restricted to the simple case of a thin bed embedded within a homogeneous formation, a situation often encountered in fractured media. Dispersive properties ofthe dielectric permittivity of investigated materials (homogeneous formation, thin bed) are described using a Jonscher parameterization, which permitted study of the dependency of amplitude and phase variation with offset (APVO) curves on frequency and thin-bed properties (filling nature, aperture). In the second part, we discuss and illustrate the validity of the thin-bed approximation as well as simplify assumptions and make necessary careful corrections to convert raw CMP data into dispersive APVO curves. Two different strategies are discussed to correct the data from propagation effects: a classical normal-moveout approach and an inverse method. Finally, the proposed methodology is applied to a CMP GPR data set acquired along a vertical cliff. It allowed us to extract the characteristics of a subvertical fracture with satisfying resolution and confidence. The study motivates interest to use dispersion dependency of the reflection coefficient variations for thin-bed characterization.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'The noninteraction approximation (NIA) is commonly used for prediction of the anisotropic elastic stiffnesses of cracked rocks. At large crack density, the NIA has a desirable nonlinear stiffness behavior; however, this is inconsistent with the dilute crack assumption. The nonlinear behavior of stiffness predicted by the NIA at high crack density is produced by defining compliance to be a linear function of crack density and then inverting the compliance tensor to stiffness. The linear behavior of compliance is strictly valid only when there is no crack interaction (at low crack density), so the resulting nonlinear stiffnesses at high crack density are unconstrained extrapolations. Comparison of results from the NIA method, an effective stiffness (T-matrix) method, and numerical modeling shows that: (1) first-order compliance methods are not better than first-order stiffness methods; they are equivalent and valid only under the noninteraction (or dilute crack) assumption; and (2) it is misleading to use the NIA at high crack density; crack interactions (shielding and amplification) should not be assumed to cancel for all crack distributions, so they require explicit consideration, for example, with a high-order T-matrix formulation. Examples of unreliable predictions of the NIA at high crack density include nonzero stiffnesses at 100% porosity for a model with dry cracks, and errors in relative stiffnesses in the isotropic limit.'],\n",

A simple wire-loop conductor has the advantage of being easily transported to the survey location and can be tuned to deliver a range of responses that will closely match the theoretical response, particularly on resistive ground. We calculated the response for such a tuned loop laid out at the surface of conductive ground and compared that response to field data. For an AEM system flown over a surface loop, when neglecting the second order of mutual induction, the receiver signal can be divided into three parts: (1) transmitter-earth-receiver (TER) signal; (2) transmitter-loop-receiver (TLR) signal; and (3) loop-earth-receiver (LER) signal. While the TER response has been extensively addressed in the literature, we modeled the more complex case of TLR and LER system responses. We first calculated the mutual inductance between the transmitter and the surface loop, tak-ing the loop impedance (resistance and inductance) into account, and then we calculated the signal in the receiver by calculating the mutual inductance between the loop and the receiver. To calculate the LER response, we divided the surface loop into a series of transmitting dipoles, with the \\u201ctransmitting\\u201d current in the dipoles obtained by analyzing the mutual induction between the transmitter and loop. The numerical experiments show that the free-space wire-loop response (TLR system) displays the standard exponential decay for a conductor. The loop resistance and inductance define the decay constant and initial signal value. While the TER system largely influences the receiver signal at early time channels for conductive earth, the LER system influences very late time channels. The more resistive the test ground is, the longer the time window is for the free-space wire-loop signal to dominate. For the survey over a test loop on conductive ground in the Dominican Republic, using the Fugro HeliGEOTEM system, the predicted response compares well to the collected data.'],\n",

The tool includes two separate focusing systems: deep-sensing (LLd) and shallow-sensing modes (LLs). Laterolog current-focusing systems were designed for operation primarily in vertical boreholes penetrating horizontal layers; only recently their design has been revised for operation in deviated wells in the presence of electrical anisotropy. We simulated three-dimensional (3D) DLL measurements in dipping, invaded, and electrically anisotropic formations and appraised the corresponding effects on apparent resistivity logs. Simulations were performed by combining the use of a Fourier-series expansion in a nonorthogonal system of coordinates with an existing 2D goal-oriented, higher-order, and self-adaptive finite-element method. This numerical algorithm yields accurate solutions in limited CPU time because only a few Fourier modes are needed to simulate practical applications. For the calculation of focused currents, we introduced an embedded postprocessing method that incorporates a synthetic focusing principle to compute current intensities at each iterative step of optimal mesh refinements. Our numerical method accurately simulates 3D DLL measurements in rock formations that exhibit extreme contrasts of electrical resistivity. Simulations indicate that LLs resistivity logs are more sensitive to both invaded and anisotropic layers than LLd resistivity logs. In deviated wells, shoulder-bed effects on apparent resistivity logs increase with an increase of dip angle, and are emphasized across thin conductive layers. Electrical anisotropy effects on apparent resistivity logs increase substantially with dip angle.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'Most permeability models use effective grain size or effective pore size as an input parameter. Until now, an efficacious way of converting between the two has not been available. We propose a simple conversion method for effective grain diameter and effective pore radius using a relationship derived by comparing two independent equations for permeability, based on the electrokinetic properties of porous media. The relationship, which we call the theta function, is not dependent upon a particular geometry and implicitly allows for the widely varying style of microstructures exhibited by porous media by using porosity, cementation exponent, formation factor, and a packing constant. The method is validated using 22 glass bead packs, for which the effective grain diameter is known accurately, and a set of 188 samples from a sand-shale sequence in the North Sea. This validation uses measurements of effective grain size from image analysis, pore size from mercury injection capillary pressure (MICP) measurements, and effective pore radius calculated from permeability experiments, all of which are independent. Validation tests agree that the technique accurately converts an effective grain diameter into an effective pore radius. Furthermore, for the clastic data set, there exists a power law relationship in porosity between effective grain size and effective pore size. The theta function also can be used to predict the fluid permeability of a sample, based on effective pore radius. The result is extremely good predictions over seven orders of magnitude.'],\n",

Existing methodology, however, is limited to zero-offset rays and cannot be applied to traveltime shifts measured on prestack seismic data. We give an analytic 3D description of stress-related traveltime shifts for rays propagating along arbitrary trajectories in heterogeneous anisotropic media. The nonlinear theory of elasticity helps to express the velocity changes in and around the reservoir through the excess stresses associated with reservoir compaction. Because this stress-induced velocity field is both heterogeneous and anisotropic, it should be studied using prestack traveltimes or amplitudes. Then we obtain the traveltime shifts by first-order perturbation of traveltimes that accounts not only for the velocity changes but also for 3D deformation of reflectors. The resulting closed-form expression can be used efficiently for numerical modeling of traveltime shifts and, ultimately, for reconstructing the stress distribution around compacting reservoirs. The analytic results are applied to a 2D model of a compacting rectangular reservoir embedded in an initially homogeneous and isotropic medium.

       " {u'abstract': [u'The anisotropy of physical properties is a well-known characteristic of many clay-bearing rocks. This anisotropy has important implications for elastic properties of rocks and must be considered in seismic modeling. Preferred orientation of clay minerals is an important factor causing anisotropy in clay-bearing rocks such as shales and mudstones that are the main cap rocks of oil reservoirs. The preferred orientation of clays depends mostly on the amount of clays and the degree of compaction. To study the effect of these parameters, we prepared several samples compressing (at two effective vertical stresses) a mixture of clays (illite and kaolinite) and quartz (silt) with different clay/quartz ratios. The preferred orientation of the phases was quantified with Rietveld analysis on synchrotron hard X-ray images. Pole figures for kaolinite and illite display a preferred orientationof clay platelets perpendicular to the compaction direction, increasing in strength with clay content and compaction pressure. Quartz particles have a random orientation distribution. Aggregate elastic properties can be estimated by averaging the single-crystal properties over the orientation distribution obtained from the diffraction data analysis. Calculated P-wave velocity anisotropy ranges from 0% (pure quartz sample) to 44% (pure clay sample, highly compacted), but calculated velocities are much higher than measured velocities. This is attributed to uncertainties about single-crystal elastic properties and oriented micropores and limited grain contacts that are not accounted for in the model. In this work, we present an effective method to obtain quantitative data, helping to evaluate the role of clay percentage and compaction pressure on the anisotropy of elastic properties of clay-bearing rocks.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'Understanding the effect of stress and pore pressure on seismic velocities is important for overpressure prediction and for 4D reflection seismic interpretation. A porosity-deformation approach (originally called the piezosensitivity theory) and its anisotropic extension describe elastic moduli of rocks as nonlinear functions of the effective stress. This theory assumes a presence of stiff and compliant parts of the pore space. The stress-dependent geometry of the compliant pore space predominantly controls stress-induced changes in elastic moduli. We show how to apply this theory to a shale that is transversely isotropic (TI) under unloaded conditions. The porosity-deformation approach shows that components of the compliance tensor depend on exponential functions of the principal components of the effective stress tensor. In the case of a hydrostatic loading of a TI rock, only the diagonal elements of this tensor, expressed in contracted notation, are significantly stress dependent. Two equal shear components of the compliance will depend on a combination of two stress exponentials. Exponents of the stress exponentials are controlled by components of the stress-sensitivity tensor. This tensor is an important physical characteristic directly related to the elastic nonlinearity of the porous rock. We simplify the porosity-deformation theory for TI rocks and provide corresponding explicit equations. We apply this theory to ultrasonic measurements on saturated shale samples from the North Sea. We show that the theory explains the compliance tensor, anellipticity, and three anisotropic parameters under a broad range of loads.'],\n",

Assuming weak anisotropy, we derive an approximate form of the anisotropic fluid-substitution equation for seismic waves propagating along the symmetry axis of a transversely isotropic medium.

The 3D geologic model supports many previous interpretations but also reveals new features of the regional geology that are important for future targeting of base-metal and gold deposits. The margins of a thick granite in the south dip steeply inward, suggesting the possibility of room to accommodate another large base-metal deposit if the granitic rocks are juxtaposed with volcanic rocks at depth.

To date, we have surveyed six fields offshore Norway; we have made three repeat surveys at one field and one repeat survey at another. We incorporated a land-gravity sensor into a remotely operated seafloor housing. Three such relative gravity sensors mounted in a single frame are carried by a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to concrete benchmarks permanently placed on the seafloor. Reference benchmarks sited outside the reservoir boundaries are assumed to provide stable fiducial points.

Geophysical fieldwide monitoring can give valuable information, particularly offshore where well control is sparse and observation wells are expensive. Advances in the accuracy of seafloor time-lapse gravimetry have made this method feasible. It can quantify which areas are flooded, providing information complementary to well-monitoring, production, and 4D seismic data. Gravimetric monitoring may aid material-balance calculations, which are vital for assessing reservoir-drive mechanism and estimating initial and remaining gas volumes. In addition, it can constrain reservoir simulation models. Our goal is to produce better physical insight into typical density changes occurring in water-drive gas fields and their associated surface-gravity response. It is feasible to monitor displacement of gas by water in reservoirs that are only a few meters thick. Gravimetric monitoring can detect edgewater encroachment in early stages.

To further the development of a high-precision absolute/relative hybrid gravity-measurement technique, we conducted measurements using an absolute gravimeter in two geothermal fields in Japan. The absolute gravity measurements were performed in the central production areas to directly measure gravity changes caused by fluid withdrawal. We succeeded in measuring long-term trends within an accuracy of a few microgals in the Okuaizu and Ogiri fields, which have been producing electricity for several years. Absolute measurements in the center of the field provide reliable and local reference datum anchor points for more widely distributed relative gravity measurements. In the Ogiri field, we carried out time-lapse hybrid measurements with this combination of absolute and relative gravimetry and delineated the spatial distributions of long- and short-term changes. The long-term changes are relatively small, considering the four-year observation interval. This suggests a near balance between the mass withdrawal rate from wells and mass recharge from peripheral regions. The apparent balance is reproduced fairly well by a preliminary numerical reservoir simulation study.

Continuous gravity studies with one to two instruments operating for a short period of time (weeks to months) have shown enticing evidence of very rapid changes in the volcanic plumbing system (minutes to hours) and in one case precursory signals leading to eruptive activity were detected.

An interim approach to consider is the development of a collaborative network of researchers able to bring multiple instruments together at key volcanoes to investigate multitemporal physical changes in a few type volcanoes. However, to truly move forward, it is imperative that new low-cost instruments are developed to increase the number of instruments available at a single site.

       " {u'abstract': [u'Time-dependent gravimetric measurements can detect subsurface processes long before magma flow leads to earthquakes or other eruption precursors. The ability of gravity measurements to detect subsurface mass flow is greatly enhanced if gravity measurements are analyzed and modeled with ground-deformation data. Obtaining the maximum information from microgravity studies requires careful evaluation of the layout of network benchmarks, the gravity environmental signal, and the coupling between gravity changes and crustal deformation. When changes in the system under study are fast (hours to weeks), as in hydrothermal systems and restless volcanoes, continuous gravity observations at selected sites can help to capture many details of the dynamics of the intrusive sources. Despite the instrumental effects, mainly caused by atmospheric temperature, results from monitoring at Mt. Etna volcano show that continuous measurements are a powerful tool for monitoring and studying volcanoes.Several analytical and numerical mathematical models can beused to fit gravity and deformation data. Analytical models offer a closed-form description of the volcanic source. In principle, this allows one to readily infer the relative importance of the source parameters. In active volcanic sites such as Long Valley caldera (California, U.S.A.) and Campi Flegrei (Italy), careful use of analytical models and high-quality data sets has produced good results. However, the simplifications that make analytical models tractable might result in misleading volcanological inter-pretations, particularly when the real crust surrounding the source is far from the homogeneous/isotropic assumption. Using numerical models allows consideration of more realistic descriptions of the sources and of the crust where they are located (e.g., vertical and lateral mechanical discontinuities, complex source geometries, and topography). Applications at Teide volcano (Tenerife) and Campi Flegrei demonstrate the importance of this more realistic description in gravity calculations.'],\n",

Such travel paths conform to the assumptions of one-way wave propagation, and most contemporary migration schemes are designed to image such data. In addition, the moveout behavior of these primary reflection events in the various prestack domains is well understood, and many of our standard data-preprocessing techniques relied on the assumption that this behavior adequately describes the events we wanted to preserve for imaging. As a corollary, events that do not conform to this prescribed behavior are classified as noise, and many of our standard preprocessing techniqueswere designed to remove them. We assessed the kinematics of moveout behavior of events that arise from two-way wave propagation and the effect of certain preprocessing techniques on those events.

       " {u'abstract': [u'Multicomponent data usually are not processed with specifically designed procedures but with procedures analogous to those used for single-component data. In isotropic media, the vertical and horizontal components of the data commonly are taken as proxies for the P- and S-wave modes, which are imaged independently with the acoustic wave equations. This procedure works only if the vertical and horizontal components accurately represent P- and S-wave modes, which generally is not true. Therefore, multicomponent images constructed with this procedure exhibit artifacts caused by incorrect wave-mode separation at the surface. An alternative procedure for elastic imaging uses the full vector fields for wavefield reconstruction and imaging. The wavefields are reconstructed using the multicomponent data as a boundary condition for a numerical solution to the elastic wave equation. The key component for wavefield migration is the imaging condition, which evaluates the match between wave-fields reconstructed from sources and receivers. For vector wave fields, a simple component-by-component crosscorrelation between two wavefields leads to artifacts caused by crosstalk between the unseparated wave modes. We can separate elastic wavefields after reconstruction in the subsurface and implement the imaging condition as crosscorrelation of pure wave modes instead of the Cartesian components of the displacement wavefield. This approach leads to images that are easier to interpret because they describe reflectivity of specified wave modes at interfaces of physical properties. As for imaging with acoustic wavefields, the elastic imaging condition can be formulated conventionally (crosscorrelation with zero lag in space and time) and extended to nonzero space and time lags. The elastic images produced by an extended imaging condition can be used for angle decomposition of primary (PP or SS) and converted (PS or SP) reflectivity. Angle gathers constructed with this procedure have applications for migration velocity analysis and amplitude-variation-with-angle analysis.'],\n",

Two-parameter methods are popular because the three-parameter inversion is often plagued by numerical instability. Reducing the dimensionality of the parameter space stabilizes the inversion. A variety of constraints can accomplish this, and these lead to the multiplicity of current two-parameter methods. It would be useful to understand relationships between various two-parameter methods. To this end, we derive formal expressions for inversion errors of each method. Using these expressions, conversion formulas are obtained that allow the flexibility to convert results of any two-parameter method to those of any other two-parameter method. The only requirement for the equivalence of methods is that the maximum angle of incidence be at least a few degrees less than the critical angle. In addition, error expressions result in a new formulation for a two-parameter AVO tool that combines strengths of two commonly used methods. The expressions also suggest a simple way to incorporate information from well-log calibration into legacy AVO inversions. These results should be helpful in resource exploration.'],\n",

The traveltime parameters estimated from each reflection must be converted into layer traveltime parameters by using the layer-stripping method. The layer traveltime parameters must be inverted into layer velocity model parameters. Interpretation or inversion of layer traveltime parameters depends on the chosen velocity model within the layer. Different or kinematically equivalent velocity distributions can result in the same traveltime parameters. The inversion problem for traveltime parameters is strongly nonunique even if they are estimated accurately. To evaluate the accuracy of a velocity model, one can choose the phase for the two-way propagator. The discrepancy in this phase factor between the kinematically equivalent velocity models depends on the number of traveltime parameters estimated and increases with spatial frequency.

Although the method is developed for small offsets, reflection angles, and velocity differences, realistic examples may be used to demonstrate that satisfactory approximations to the residual moveout curve can be obtained over a relatively wide range of offsets or reflection angles and for moderate velocity differences. A zero-offset inversion was applied to the estimated residual radii of curvature. This inversion was performed layerwise. For each layer, the velocity was assumed to vary according to a known depth-varying and a laterally varying component to be determined.

       " {u'abstract': [u'A seismic depth-imaging project starts from an initial depth model of interval velocities. From time processing of reflection seismic data, a set of stacking parameters or kinematic data attributes usually is available for an initial model building at little effort. Two methods for initial model building from time-processing attributes are compared in this case study, using 3D seismic land data from the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Conventional normal moveout (NMO)/dip moveout (DMO) time processing performs one-parametric stacking using stacking velocity as the parameter. The stacking velocity field can be converted into a depth model by the well-known vertical Dix inversion, which is very fast and robust but degrades with increasing dip. Common-reflection surface (CRS) time processing, on the contrary, isbased on the multiparametric CRS stacking approach, providing several volumes of CRS-stacking attributes that include the wavefield dip, or horizontal slowness. Inversion of CRS attributes by CRS tomography incorporates this dip information in depth model building. In this case study, CRS or normal-incidence point (NIP) wave tomography is presented as a model-building link between high-resolution CRS time processing and subsequent depth processing. The CRS tomography model shows a better adaptation to the dipping subsurface structures than the Dix model and a good fit to well data. The smooth tomography model is well suited for further use in poststack and prestack depth migrations. It provides a good starting point for iterative model enhancement and salt-body definition in prestack depth migration.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'Velocity-model determination during seismic data processing is crucial for any kind of depth imaging. We compared two approaches of grid tomography: prestack stereotomography and normal-incidence-point (NIP) wave tomography. Whereas NIP wave tomography is based on wavefield attributes obtained during the common reflection surface stack and thus on the underlying hyperbolic second-order traveltime approximation, prestack stereotomography describes traveltimes by local slopes (i.e., linearly) in the prestack data domain. To analyze the impact of the different traveltime approximations and the different input-data domains on velocity model building, we applied two implementations of these techniques to two profiles of a field marine data set from the Levante Basin, eastern Mediterranean. Because ofthe presence of a thick, tabular mobile unit of the Messinian evaporites, strong vertical and lateral velocity contrasts had been expected. The velocity models revealed the reconstruction of high-velocity contrasts by grid tomographic methods is limited because of the smooth description of the velocity distribution. The lateral resolution of velocities obtained from prestack stereotomography appears to be better than those from NIP wave tomography, which is related to the difference in the approximation of traveltimes, the determination of input data, and the description of the velocity distribution. Other differences are caused mainly by different implementations of the inversion schemes. Nevertheless, both algorithms provide suitable models for high-quality depth imaging, whereas most of the reflections are fairly flat in CIGs.'],\n",

In addition, the presence of shallow gas generates strong surface-related and interbed multiples, making velocity updating very difficult. When localized gas pockets are very shallow, we have limited information to build a near-surface velocity model using ray-based reflection tomography alone. Diving-wave refraction tomography successfully builds a starting model for the very shallow part. Usual ray-based reflection tomography using single-parameter hyperbolic moveout might need many iterations to update the deeper part of the velocity model. In addition, the method generates a low-velocity anomaly in the deeper part of the model. We present an innovative method for building the final velocity model by combining refraction, reflection, and wave-equation-based tomography. Wave-equation-based tomography effectively generates a detailed update of a shallow velocity field, resolving the gas-sag problem. When applied as the last step, following the refraction and reflection tomography, it resolves the gas-sag problem but fails to remove the low-velocity anomaly generated by the reflection tomography in the deeper part of the model. To improve the methodology, we update the shallow velocity field using refraction tomography followed by wave-equation tomography before updating the deeper part of the model. This step avoids generating the low-velocity anomaly. Refraction and wave-equation-based tomography followed by reflection tomography generates a simpler velocity model, giving better focusing in the deeper part of the image. We illustrate how the methodology successfully improves resolution of gas anomalies and significantly reduces gas sag from an imaged section in the Greater Cassia area, Trinidad.'],\n",

However, after this process, no information is available on the accuracy of this velocity model. A statistical analysis of velocity-model parameters is very difficult because of the integrated nature of the process. In common-focus-point technology, velocity estimation is split into two processes: a first step to estimate one-way focusing operators from the seismic data and a second step to translate these one-way propagation operators into a velocity-depth model. Because the second step does not involve seismic data and uses a hands-off model parameterization, a statistical analysis of the inversion result becomes rather straightforward. We developed a methodology for obtaining a suite of possible solutions, from which statistical measures can be extracted. By varying initial settings, the inversion of one-way traveltimes provides a space of solutions. Rather than having a single estimated model, we can obtain an ensemble of models. By performing statistical analysis of this ensemble, the error bars of the estimated velocity model can be retrieved. The procedure was tested for a 2D synthetic and field data set, for which the latter compares favorably to a conventional two-way traveltime tomography approach. The information provided by such an analysis is important because it shows the reliability of the final estimated model and could provide feedback for acquisition geometry design.

Depth-imaging artifacts are poorly constrained velocity results that cause defocusing and/or incorrect structures in the migrated stack. The quality of an inverted velocity distribution from a tomographic approach depends heavily on ray coverage. In areas of poor ray coverage with a small ray count or parallel rays, the velocity distribution can be nonunique because of the lack of constraints. In the case of large residual moveouts from prestack migration, which most likely could happen in the presence of a complex geologic setting, serious depth-imaging artifacts can appear in the velocity field inverted using SST. To solve this problem, we tested the ability of MST to constrain artifacts in a case study. MST parameterizes the study area into overlapping submodels of different grid sizes. The inverted velocity-perturbation value for a specific location is the superposition of velocity-perturbation values from those submodels. The submodel with a large grid size provides a stable regional value that helps constrain local artifacts from submodels of smaller grid sizes. Artifacts using SST are suppressed significantly by MST.

Difficult geologic settings, steep dips, and other wave-propagation effects make reverse-time migration (RTM) the migration method of choice, rather than Kirchhoff migration or other (by definition approximate) one-way equation methods. Imaging of the subsurface using any depth-migration algorithm can be done successfully only when the quality of the prior velocity model is sufficient. The (velocity) model-building loop is an iterative procedure for improving the velocity model. This is done by obtaining certain measurements (residual moveout) on image gathers generated during the migration procedure; those measurements then are input into tomographic updating. Commonly RTM is applied around salt bodies, where building the velocity model fails essentially because tomography is ray-trace based. Our idea is to apply RTM directly inside the model-building loop but to do so without using the image gathers. Although the process is costly, we migrate the full frequency content of the data to create a high-quality stack. This enhances the interpretation of top and bottom salt significantly and enables us to include the resulting salt geometry in the velocity model properly. We demonstrate our idea on a 2D West Africa seismic line. After several model-building iterations, the result is a dramatically improved velocity model. With such a good model as input, the final RTM confirms the geometry of the salt bodies and basically the salt interpretation, and yields a compelling image of the subsurface.'],\n",

We established theoretical relations between the time-migration velocity and seismic velocity in two and three dimensions using paraxial ray-tracing theory. The relation in two dimensions implies that the conventional Dix velocity is the ratio of the interval seismic velocity and the geometric spreading of image rays. We formulated an inverse problem of finding seismic velocity from the Dix velocity and developed a numerical procedure for solving it. The procedure consists of two steps: (1) computation of the geometric spreading of image rays and the true seismic velocity in time-domain coordinates from the Dix velocity; (2) conversion of the true seismic velocity from the time domain to the depth domain and computation of the transition matrices from time-domain coordinates todepth. For step 1, we derived a partial differential equation (PDE) in two and three dimensions relating the Dix velocity and the geometric spreading of image rays to be found. This is a nonlinear elliptic PDE. The physical setting allows us to pose a Cauchy problem for it. This problem is ill posed, but we can solve it numerically in two ways on the required interval of time, if it is sufficiently short. One way is a finite-difference scheme inspired by the Lax-Friedrichs method. The second way is a spectral Chebyshev method. For step 2, we developed an efficient Dijkstra-like solver motivated by Sethian\\u2019s fast marching method. We tested numerical procedures on a synthetic data example and applied them to a field data example. We demonstrated that the algorithms produce a significantly more accurate estimate of seismic velocity than the conventional Dix inversion.

A wavepath is obtained by multiplying impulse responses from a surface location and a reflection point. The inversion matrix is kept to a manageable size by restricting the wavepath to the first Fresnel zone.

We have highlighted some recent advances in building a velocity model for subsalt imaging. There are three main stages: suprasalt velocity determination, salt-model definition, and subsalt velocity update. Volumetric high-resolution tomography that incorporates high-velocity contrast boundaries is used to derive a good sediment velocity model before building a salt model. To facilitate integration of interpretation and depth processing, beam-based interactive imaging is used to refine the salt geometry. For subsalt velocity update, either subsalt tomography or subsalt scan-based techniques can be used, depending on the quality of subsalt reflections. There are concepts and techniques for attaining subsalt images suitable for hydrocarbon exploration beneath complexly shaped salt bodies.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'Image-wave propagation or velocity continuation describes the variation of the migrated position of a seismic event as a function of migration velocity. Image-wave propagation in the common-image gather (CIG) domain can be combined with residual-moveout analysis for iterative migration velocity analysis (MVA). Velocity continuation of CIGs leads to a detection of those velocities in which events flatten. Although image-wave continuation is based on the assumption of a constant migration velocity, the procedure can be applied in inhomogeneous media. For this purpose, CIGs obtained by migration with an inhomogeneous macrovelocity model are continued starting from a constant reference velocity. The interpretation of continued CIGs, as if they were obtained from residual migrations, leads to a correction formula that translates residual flattening velocities into absolute time-migration velocities. In this way, the migration velocity model can be improved iteratively until a satisfactory result is reached. With a numerical example, we found that MVA with iterative image continuation applied exclusively to selected CIGs can construct a reasonable migration velocity model from scratch, without the need to build an initial model from a previous conventional normal-moveout/dip-moveout velocity analysis.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'Wave-equation migration velocity analysis (MVA) is a technique similar to wave-equation tomography because it is designed to update velocity models using information derived from full seismic wavefields. On the other hand, wave-equation MVA is similar to conventional, traveltime-based MVA because it derives the information used for model updates from properties of migrated images, e.g., focusing and moveout. The main motivation for using wave-equation MVA is derived from its consistency with the corresponding wave-equation migration, which makes this technique robust and capable of handling multipathing characterizing media with large and sharp velocity contrasts. The wave-equation MVA operators are constructed using linearizations of conventional wavefield extrapolation operators, assuming small perturbations relative to the background velocity model. Similar to typical wavefield extrapolation operators, the wave-equation MVA operators can be implemented in the mixed space-wavenumber domain using approximations of differentorders of accuracy. As for wave-equation migration, wave-equation MVA can be formulated in different imaging frameworks, depending on the type of data used and image optimization criteria. Examples of imaging frameworks correspond to zero-offset migration (designed for imaging based on focusing properties of the image), survey-sinking migration (designed for imaging based on moveout analysis using narrow-azimuth data), and shot-record migration (also designed for imaging based on moveout analysis, but using wide-azimuth data). The wave-equation MVA operators formulated for the various imaging frameworks are similar because they share elements derived from linearizations of the single square-root equation. Such operators represent the core of iterative velocity estimation based on diffraction focusing or semblance analysis, and their applicability in practice requires efficient and accurate implementation. This tutorial concentrates strictly on the numeric implementation of those operators and not on their use for iterative migration velocity analysis.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'Prestack depth migration has been used for decades to derive velocity distributions in depth. Numerous tools and methodologies have been developed to reach this goal. Exploration in geologically more complex areas exceeds the abilities of existing methods. New data-acquisition and data-processing methods are required to answer these new challenges effectively. The recently introduced wide-azimuth data acquisition method offers better illumination and noise attenuation as well as an opportunity to more accurately determine velocities for imaging. One of the most advanced tools for depth imaging is full-waveform inversion. Prestack seismic full-waveform inversion is very challenging because of the nonlinearity and nonuniqueness of the solution. Combined with multiple iterations of forward modeling and residual wavefield back propagation, the method is computer intensive, especially for 3D projects. We studied a time-domain, plane-wave implementation of 3D waveform inversion. We found that plane-wave gathers are an attractive input to waveform inversion with dramatically reduced computer run times compared to traditional shot-gather approaches. The study was conducted on two synthetic data sets \\u2014 Marmousi2 and SMAART Pluto 1.5 \\u2014 and a field data set. The results showed that a velocity field can be reconstructed well using a multiscale time-domain implementation of waveform inversion. Although the time-domain solution does not take advantage of wavenumber redundancy, the method is feasible on current computer architectures for 3D surveys. The inverted velocity volume produces a quality image for exploration geologists by using numerous iterations of waveform inversion.'],\n",

The velocity model is represented with a low-spatial-frequency parameterization (2D cubic B-splines) designed specifically for the predicted components of the data. This model parameterization effectively decouples the slowly varying background from the higher spatial-frequency component of the velocity field produced by shallow, low-velocity, gas-charged sands and allows the solution to be obtained in a single iteration. The observed first-arrival times (background and shallow anomaly-induced perturbations) and the slowly varying first-arrival times related to the background velocity are inverted separately. Similar velocity-model estimates result, demonstrating the decoupling imposed by the B-spline model parameterization. The background velocity and the low-velocity anomalies are best treated as separate inverse problems using very different model parameterizations. Ray tracing a synthetic model containing local low-velocity anomalies embedded in a smooth background does not accurately predict the anomaly-induced first-arrival time perturbations seen in the field data. Acoustic finite-difference waveform modeling shows that reflections and diffractions from the anomalies interfere with the diving-wave first arrivals.

The differential semblance approach to velocity analysis uses waveform data directly: it does not require any sort of traveltime picking. The objective function minimized by the differential semblance algorithm can measure either focusing of the image in offset or flatness of the image in (scattering) angle. We showed that the offset variant of differential semblance yields somewhat more reliable migration velocity estimates than does the scattering angle variant, and we explain why this is so. We observed that inconsistency with the underlying model (Born scattering about a transparent background) can lead to degraded velocity estimates from differential semblance, and we showed how to augment the objective function with stack power to enhance ultimate accuracy. A 2D marine survey over a target obscured by the lensing effects of a gas chimney provides an opportunity for direct comparison of differential semblance with reflection tomography.

We present a new method for solving the nonlinear tomographic inverse problem using 3D prestack-depth-migrated reflections as the input data, i.e., our method requires that prestack depth migration (PSDM) be performed before tomography. The method is applicable to any type of seismic data acquisition that permits seismic imaging with Kirchhoff PSDM. A fundamental concept of the method is that we dissociate the possibly incorrect initial migration velocity model from the tomographic velocity model. We take the initial migration velocity model and the residual moveout in the associated PSDM common-image gathers as the reference data. This allows us to consider the migrated depth of the initial PSDM as the invariant observation for the tomographic inverse problem. We can therefore formulate the inverse problem within the general framework of inverse theory as a nonlinear least-squares data fitting between observed and modeled migrated depth. The modeled migrated depth is calculated by ray tracing in the tomographic model, followed by a finite-offset map migration in the initial migration model. The inverse problem is solved iteratively with a Gauss-Newton algorithm. We applied the method to a North Sea data set to build an anisotropic layer velocity model.'],\n",

We modified this criterion to measure robustly the amplitude and phase spectrum of the wavelet in the presence of noise. No minimum phase assumptions were made.

       " {u'abstract': [u'We have developed the theoretical foundation and technical details of a migration method using a local-cosine-bases (LCB) beamlet propagator. A beamlet propagator for heterogeneous media based on local perturbation theory is derived, and a fast implementation method is constructed. The use of local background velocities and local perturbations results in a two-scale decomposition of beamlet propagators: a background propagator for large-scale structures and a local phase-screen correction for small-scale local perturbations. Because of its locally adaptive nature, the beamlet propagator can handle strong lateral velocity variations with improved accuracy. For high-efficiency migration, we use a table-driven method and apply some techniques of sparse matrix operations. Compared with the Fourier finite-dif-ference and generalized screen propagator methods, the image quality and computational efficiency are similar. In some cases, we see fewer migration artifacts around and inside salt bodies with our method. We attribute this to the better high-angle accuracy of beamlet propagators in strong-contrast media. Numerical tests using synthetic data sets of the SEG-EAGE 2D salt model, Marmousi model, and Sigsbee 2A model demonstrate its high accuracy and reasonable efficiency. Another special feature of LCB beamlet migration is the availability of information in the local wavenumber domain during migration, which can be used to correct acquisition aperture effect and for other processing. Compared to beamlet migration using the Gabor-Daubechies frame (GDF) propagator, LCB migration is much more efficient because LCB is an orthonormal basis, whereas GDF has redundancy (usually greater than two) in the decomposition.'],\n",

Waves illuminating steeply dipping reflectors, such as overturned waves and waves traveling nearly horizontally, are extrapolated accurately in an appropriate tilted coordinate system because the extrapolation direction is close to the propagation directions for these waves.

       " {u'abstract': [u'We investigated the effect of errors in the migration-velocity model of PS-converted waves on the traveltime calculated in prestack Kirchhoff time migration in weak anisotropic media. The prestack-Kirchhoff-time-migration operator contains four parameters: the PS-converted-wave velocity, the vertical velocity ratio, the effective velocity ratio, and the anisotropic parameter. We derived four error factors that correspond to those parameters. Theoretical and numerical analyses of the error factors show them all to be inversely proportional to the velocity and to traveltime. Traveltime errors for shallow events usually are larger than for deep events. Error in PS-converted-wave velocity causes the largest traveltime error, and error in the vertical velocity ratio causes the smallest traveltime error. For a small horizontal-distance/depth ratio, the error in the effective velocity ratio affects traveltime more than does the anisotropic-parameter error. However, the anisotropic-parameter error affects traveltime more when the horizontal-distance/depth ratio is larger. Traveltime errors caused by errors in effective velocity ratio and the anisotropic parameter mainly stem from the converted-S-wave raypath of the PS-converted waves. To save processing time and cost, PS-wave velocity can be estimated accurately without an accurate vertical velocity ratio, effective velocity ratio, and anisotropic parameter. These findings are useful for understanding PS-wave behavior and for PS-wave imaging in anisotropic media.'],\n",

Reverse-time extrapolation of elastic data assumes that only the incident P- or S-waves are reconstructed during extrapolation into the computational grid. However, superposition of the (upgoing) incident waves and the (downgoing) reflected and converted waves generated at the free surface also is recorded in data acquisition and is input into reverse-time extrapolation. In elastic reverse-time extrapolation, the computational model needs to have an absorbing top boundary. When the 3D, 3-C elastic data are inserted into the computational model during reverse-time extrapolation, the originally incident P- or S-wave is reconstructed. In addition, the free-surface P-to-P reflected and P-to-S converted waves recombine to reconstruct a second incident P-wave, and the free-surface S-to-S reflected and S-to-P converted waves recombine to reconstruct a second incident S-wave. Therefore, 3D elastic reverse-time extrapolation reconstructs the incident waves with displacement amplitudes increased by a fixed factor of exactly two when free-surface reflections and conversions are in the data. In this implementation, reconstructed (virtual) waves propagating upward from the free surface enter an absorbing zone and disappear.'],\n",

A poststack migration example illustrates advantages of elliptical coordinates for imaging turning waves. A 2D imaging test using a velocity-benchmark data set demonstrates that the RWE prestack migration algorithm generates high-quality prestack migration images that are more accurate than those generated by Cartesian operators of the equivalent accuracy.

       " {u'abstract': [u'Linearized-inversion methods often have the disadvantage of dependence on the initial model. When the initial model is far from the global minimum, optimization is likely to converge to a local minimum. Optimization problems involving nonlinear relationships between data and model are likely to have more than one local minimum. Such problems are solved effectively by using global-optimization methods, which are exhaustive search techniques and hence are computationally expensive. As model dimensionality increases, the search space becomes large, making the algorithm very slow in convergence. We propose a new approach to the global-optimization scheme that incorporates a priori knowledge in the algorithm by preconditioning the model space using edge-preserving smoothing operators. Such nonlinear operators acting on the model space favorably precondition or bias the model space for blocky solutions. This approach not only speeds convergence but also retrieves blocky solutions. We apply the algorithm to estimate the layer parameters from the amplitude-variation-with-offset data. The results indicate that global optimization with model-space-preconditioning operators provides faster convergence and yields a more accurate blocky-model solution that is consistent with a priori information.'],\n",

Consequently, it is desirable to take into consideration the effects of wave propagation in the subsurface structure when designing an acquisition geometry. We developed a new, model-based implementation of the previously introduced focal-beam analysis method. The method\\u2019s objective is to provide quantitative insight into the combined influence of acquisition geometry, overburden structure, and migration operators on image resolution and angle-dependent amplitude accuracy. This is achieved by simulation of migrated grid-point responses using focal beams. Note that the seismic response of any subsurface can be composed of a linear sum of grid-point responses. The focal beams have been chosen because any migration process represents double focusing. In addition, the focal source beam and focal detector beam relate migration quality to illumination properties of the source geometry and sensing properties of the detector geometry, respectively. Wave-equation modeling ensures that frequency-dependent effects in the seismic-frequency range are incorporated. We tested our method by application to a 3D salt model in the Gulf of Mexico. Investigation of well-sampled, all-azimuth, long-offset acquisition geometries revealed fundamental illumination and sensing limitations. Further results exposed the shortcomings of narrow-azimuth data acquisition. The method also demonstrates how acquisition-related amplitude errors affect seismic inversion results.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'A rigorous physical-mathematical model of heterogeneous conductive media is based on the effective-medium approach. A generalization of the classical effective-medium theory (EMT) consists of two major parts: (1) introduction of effective-conductivity models of heterogeneous, multiphase rock formations with inclusions of arbitrary shape and conductivity using the principles of the quasi-linear (QL) approximation within the framework of the EMT formalism and (2) development of the generalized effective-medium theory of induced polarization (GEMTIP), which takes into account electromagnetic-induction (EMI) and induced polarization (IP) effects related to the relaxation of polarized charges in rock formations. The new generalized EMT provides a unified mathematical model of heterogeneity, multiphase structure, and the polarizability of rocks. The geoelectric parameters of this model are determined by the intrinsic petrophysical and geometric characteristics of composite media: the mineralization and/or fluid content of rocks and the matrix composition, porosity, anisotropy, and polarizability of formations. The GEMTIP model allows one to find the effective conductivity of a medium with inclusions that have arbitrary shape and electrical properties. One fundamental IP model of an isotropic, multiphase, heterogeneous medium is filled with spherical inclusions. This model, because of its relative simplicity, makes it possible to explain the close relationships between the new GEMTIP conductivity-relaxation model and an empirical Cole-Cole model or classical Wait\\u2019s model of the IP effect.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'This study was devoted to the interpretation of the evolution of elastic wave velocities in anisotropic shales that are subjected to deformation experiments in the laboratory. A micromechanical model was used to describe the macroscopic effective elastic properties and anisotropy of the rock in terms of its microscopic features, such as intrinsic anisotropy and crack/pore geometry. The experimental data (reported in Part 1) were compared quantitatively with the micromechanical model predictions to gain some insight into the microstructural behavior of the rock during deformation. The inversion of the experimental data using the micromechanical model was carried out by means of a numerical minimization of the least-squares distance between data and model in terms of effective compliances. Under isotropic mechanical loading, the overall behavior of the dry shale is consistent with the closure of crack-like pores, which are aligned in theplane of symmetry of the transversely isotropic background matrix. Those cracks represent a low fraction of the total porosity, but they have a strong effect on elastic wave velocities. The data are consistent with an initial (horizontal) crack density of 0.07. Crack closure also is evidenced at early stages of axial loading applied perpendicular to the shale bedding plane, whereas crack density increases significantly as axial stress is increased. Interpretation of the wet experiment is less straightforward, although some preliminary conclusions could be drawn. Under isotropic stress, crack closure also is evidenced, whereas crack density remains constant at the early stages of deviatoric loading. When axial peak stress is approached, crack density increases drastically, which likely indicates onset and development of vertical cracking. Wet experiments probably are more complex because water is likely to be expelled from crack-like pores toward equant pores in response to the mechanical loading.'],\n",

In principle, the high-frequency spectral content and amplitude of seismic reflection data should decrease with increasing traveltime as a result of absorption, geometric spreading, and scattering so long as seismic energy continues to return from deeper levels of the subsurface. As a result, if average frequency and amplitude cease to decrease with depth, background noise, rather than returning seismic energy, likely dominates the record. Average frequency increases and average amplitude remains comparatively constant below bright reflections overlying transitional crust on the Newfoundland margin.

The classic approach to measuring azimuthal anisotropy at depth involves layer stripping. Its inherent weakness is the need to measure and undo overburden effects before arriving at an anisotropy estimate at depth. That task is challenging when the overburden is complex and varies quickly with depth. Moreover, VSP receivers are rarely present all the way from the surface to the target. That necessitates the use of simplistic assumptions about the uninstrumented part of the overburden that limit the quality of the result. We propose a new technique for measuring shear-wave splitting at depth that does not require any knowledge of the overburden. It is based on a multicomponent version of the virtual source method in which each two-component (2-C) VSP receiver is turned into a 2-C shear source and recorded at deeper geophones. The resulting virtual data set is affected only by the properties of the medium between the receivers.

       "   u', we refer to all types of waves that scatter multiple times inside the model. These include, for instance, interbed, intrasalt, and water-bottom multiples as well as conversions among them. We use an interferometry technique that is based on representation theorems for perturbed media and targets the reconstruction of specific primary reflections from multiply reflected waves. In this interferometry approach, we rely on shot-domain wavenumber separation to select the directions of waves arriving at a given receiver. Using a numerical walkaway (WAW) VSP experiment recorded by a subsalt borehole receiver array in the Sigsbee salt model, we use the interference of internal multiples to image the salt structure from below. In this numerical example, the interferometric image that uses internal multiples reconstructs the bottom- and top-of-salt reflectors above the receiver array as well as the subsalt sediment structure between the array and the salt. Because of the limited source summation in this interferometry example, the interferometric images show artifact reflectors within the salt body. We apply this method to a field walkaway VSP from the Gulf of Mexico. With the field data, we demonstrate that the choice of shot-domain wavenumbers in the target-oriented interferometry procedure controls the wavenumbers in the output pseudoshot gathers. Target-oriented interferometric imaging from the 20-receiver array recovers the top-of-salt reflector that is consistent with surface seismic images.

The method is novel in the way we incorporate spatial dependence to solve large-scale, real-world problems by integrating the decision-theoretical concept of value of information with rock physics and statistics. The method is based on a statistical model for saturation and porosity on a lattice along the top reservoir. Our model treats these variables as spatially correlated. The porosity and saturation are tied to the seismic and electromagnetic data via nonlinear rock-physics relations. We efficiently approximate the posterior distribution for the reservoir variables in a Bayesian model by fitting a Gaussian at the posterior mode for transformed versions of saturation and porosity.

We extend it to general anisotropic media and implement it for media with elliptic and anelliptic anisotropy. Such media depend on only three elastic parameters, which makes stereotomography less sensitive to ambiguity resulting from limited coverage of surface seismic experiments than it would be in transversely isotropic or orthorhombic media. The corresponding approximations of the slowness surface restrict the validity of the present approach to qP events and mild anisotropy. Our numerical analysis demonstrates that stereotomography can be used to estimate macrovelocity models in the presence of anisotropy. For elliptic anisotropy, the parameter that is most difficult to estimate is the orientation of the symmetry axis. For anelliptic anisotropy, estimation of stereotomography parameters is possible in principle; however, it will be mostly ill conditioned in practice, even for low noise levels.

       " {u'abstract': [u'It is accepted widely that the Biot theory predicts only one shear wave representing the in-phase/unison shear motions of the solid and fluid constituent phases (fast S-wave). The Biot theory also contains a shear mode wherein the two constituent phases essentially undergo out-of-phase shear motions (slow S-wave). From the outset of the development of the Biot framework, the existence of this mode has remained unnoticed because of an oversight in decoupling its system of two coupled equations governing shear processes. Moreover, in the absence of the fluid strain-rate term in the Biot constitutive relation, the velocity of this mode is zero. Once the Biot constitutive relation is corrected for the missing fluid strain-rate term (i.e., fluid viscosity), this mode turns out to be, in the inertial regime, a diffusive process akin to a viscous wave in a Newtonian fluid. In the viscous regime, it degenerates to a process governed by a diffusion equation with a damping term. Although this mode is damped so heavily that it dies off rapidly near its source, overlooking its existence ignores a mechanism to draw energy from seismic waves (fast P- and S-waves) via mode conversion at interfaces and at other material discontinuities and inhomogeneities. To illustrate the consequence of generating this mode at an interface, I examine the case of a horizontally polarized fast S-wave normal incident upon a planar air-water interface in a porous medium. Contrary to the classical Biot framework, which suggests that the incident wave should be transmitted practically unchanged through such an interface, the viscosity-corrected Biot framework predicts a strong, fast S-wave reflection because of the slow S-wave generated at the interface.'],\n",

The evaluation of a synthetic data set with a lateral variability in reflector depth and an experimental example with a large variability in soil-water content are introduced to demonstrate the applicability for field-scale measurements.

       " {u'abstract': [u'An important potential application of the electrical-resistivity method occurs in salinity studies of lakes and water reservoirs. However, uncertainty exists because there is a problem of equivalence in resistivity data interpretation and because the resistivity variation in the water layer in reservoirs is subtle (contrasts of a factor of two) and changes over short intervals of time (typically in hours or days). We carry out numerical modeling and inversion of synthetic data and field resistivity data from Lake Whitney, Texas, U.S.A., to examine how accurately resistivity in the water column in reservoirs can be determined using the electrical-resistivity method. Our objective is to advance the method as a tool in limnologic research for mapping freshwater zones in impacted lakes and water reservoirs. The simulated freshwater target in the synthetic data effectively is realized from the inversion with root-mean-square (rms) error less than 10%. However, the resolutionof the inverted sections decreases with increasing noise. Inversions of the field apparent-resistivity data from three profiles in the lake, computed using estimated optimization parameters from the synthetic study, reveal the possible pattern of salinity distributions in the reservoir. For unconstrained inversion schemes, comparisons of the inverted and independently measured in situ water electrical-conductivity data yield an average rms error of 10.8%. This error value is reduced to approximately 5% with inclusions of a priori information on water resistivity in the inversion scheme. We observe an inverse relationship between error level and number of constraints on water resistivity. In general, results show that the electrical-resistivity method is a viable tool for mapping salinity variations in reservoirs. However, good data quality and inclusion of measured water conductivity as constraints in the inversion schemes are important to enhance accuracy of the inversion results.'],\n",

The cross-gradients function has been introduced as a means to construct models in which spatial changes in two distinct physical-property models are parallel or antiparallel. Inversion methods that use such structural constraints also provide estimates of nonlinear and nonunique field-scale relationships between model parameters. Here, we jointly invert crosshole radar and seismic traveltimes for structurally similar models using an iterative nonlinear traveltime tomography algorithm. Application of the inversion scheme to synthetic data demonstrates that it better resolves lithologic boundaries than the individual inversions alone. Tests of the scheme on GPR and seismic data acquired within a shallow aquifer illustrate that the resultant models have improved correlations with flowmeter data in comparison with models based on individual inversions. The highest correlation with the flowmeter data is obtained when the joint inversion is combined with a stochastic regularization operator and the vertical integral scale is estimated from the flowmeter data.

We present a simple calibration method that serves to define these issues by the use of a closed multiturn loop of known electrical and physical properties that is insulated from the ground beneath it. By predicting the secondary response of the AEM receiver and comparing it with the measured data, we have identified and quantified systematic errors mentioned above in several systems. In addition, we identify an alternative subprocess that uniquely calculates altimeter and geometry errors by measuring the current induced in a ground loop of known properties and comparing it with predictions.

The forward algorithm is based on a finite-difference approach in which a multifrontal LU decomposition algorithm simulates multisource experiments at nearly the cost of simulating one single-source experiment for each frequency of operation. When the size of the linear system of equations is large, the use of this noniterative solver is impractical. Hence, we use the optimal grid technique to limit the number of unknowns in the forward problem. The inversion algorithm employs a regularized Gauss-Newton minimization approach with a multiplicative cost function. By using this multiplicative cost function, we do not need a priori data to determine the so-called regularization parameter in the optimization process, making the algorithm fully automated. The algorithm is equipped with two regularization cost functions that allow us to reconstruct either a smooth or a sharp conductivity image. To increase the robustness of the algorithm, we also constrain the minimization and use a line-search approach to guarantee the reduction of the cost function after each iteration. To demonstrate the pros and cons of the algorithm, we present synthetic and field data inversion results for crosswell and controlled-source EM measurements.'],\n",

Such systems are very sensitive to conductive structures buried at shallow depths. Frequently, they are only used to locate and delimit these structures by direct observation of data. However, much more information can be obtained by applying numerical modeling techniques to the data. First we mapped an anomalous zone that indicates the possible presence of buried waste or some other underground contamination by visualizing data. Then we applied a 1D inversion method to the data from this zone. By joining 1D inversion results, this method builds 2D images of the subsoil structure below survey lines. Because the code applies smoothness constraints to the 1D inversions, the subsoil properties in these 2D images change gradually with depth. The code does not impose any correlation between the data or 1D models corresponding to neighboring points, so sharp lateral changes can appear. Several of them do not represent real features of the subsoil. We designed and applied two spatial filters to smooth the spurious lateral variations in our models. One correlates the data acquired at adjacent points prior to inversions. The other applies an analogous correlation to the inverse models obtained from the original data. Both filters greatly improve the quality of the 2D images. Compiling these results, we obtained a 3D model of the subsoil that characterizes the anomalous structure.

Without the connector in place, the tool measured formation arrivals that were consistent with wireline-logging predictions. With the connector in place, the coupling of the source and receiver sections resulted in strong tool waves that could mask formation arrivals. In general, the quadrupole mode more consistently provided correct formation shear-wave velocities because the tool modes propagated with higher velocities and could be separated from the formation shear arrivals. The dipole tool mode often could interfere with the formation flexural wave, especially for soft formations. By increasing the operating frequency of the source, tool waves could be eliminated and formation arrivals more easily measured in all cases. Based on these observations, it is important to choose the optimum working frequencies in LWD to reduce tool modes and allow formation shear velocities to be measured with dipole or quadrupole tools, particularly in anisotropic formations.'],\n",

We estimate viscoelastic properties of mixtures of rock and heavy oil by considering (1) a system of layers of a solid and a viscoelastic medium and (2) by computing Hashin-Shtrikman (HS) bounds for this system. These two methods give approximate bounds for the frequency- and temperature-dependent velocities and attenuation coefficients in rocks saturated with heavy oil.

These elastic models should include not only the fluid saturation effects of intrinsic, shape-induced, and stress-induced anisotropy, but also should incorporate nonlinear stress-dependent elasticity. To model nonlinear elasticity, we use a microstructural effective-medium approach in which elasticity is considered as a function of mineral stiffness and additional compliance is caused by the presence of low-aspect ratio displacement discontinuities. By jointly inverting observed ultrasonic P- and S-wave velocities to determine the distribution of such discontinuities, we assessed the appropriateness of modeling them as simple, planar, penny-shaped features. By using this approximation, we developed a simple analytical approach to predict how seismic velocities will vary with stress.

Thus the reflection moveout away from the borehole is controlled largely by the velocity along the TI-symmetry axis. Consequently, reflection imaging using measured velocity along the borehole can cause errors in the imaged reflector position.

       " {u'abstract': [u'Deconvolution interferometry successfully recovers the impulse response between two receivers without the need for an independent estimate of the source function. Here we extend the method of interferometry by deconvolution to multicomponent data in elastic media. As in the acoustic case, elastic deconvolution interferometry retrieves only causal scattered waves that propagate between two receivers as if one acts as a pseudosource of the point-force type. Interferometry by deconvolution in elastic media also generates artifacts because of a clamped-point boundary condition imposed by the deconvolution process. In seismic-while-drilling (SWD) practice, the goal is to determine the subsurface impulse response from drill-bit noise records. Most SWD technologies rely on pilot sensors and/or models to predict the drill-bit source function, whose imprint is then removed from the data. Interferometry by deconvolution is of most use to SWD applications in which pilot records are absent or provide unreliable estimates of bit excitation. With a numerical SWD subsalt example, we show that deconvolution interferometry provides an image of the subsurface that cannot be obtained by correlations without an estimate of the source autocorrelation. Finally, we test the use of deconvolution interferometry in processing SWD field data acquired at the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD). Because no pilot records were available for these data, deconvolution outperforms correlation in obtaining an interferometric image of the San Andreas fault zone at depth.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'Interferometry allows for synthesis of data recorded at any two receivers into waves that propagate between these receivers as if one of them behaves as a source. This is accomplished typically by crosscorrelations. Based on perturbation theory and representation theorems, we show that interferometry also can be done by deconvolutions for arbitrary media and multidimensional experiments. This is important for interferometry applications in which (1) excitation is a complicated source-time function and/or (2) when wavefield separation methods are used along with interferometry to retrieve specific arrivals. Unlike using crosscorrelations, this method yields only causal scattered waves that propagate between the receivers. We offer a physical interpretation of deconvolution interferometry based on scattering theory. Here we show that deconvolution interferometry in acoustic media imposes an extra boundary condition, which we refer to as the free-point or clamped-point boundary condition, depending on the measured field quantity. This boundary condition generates so-called free-point scattering interactions, which are described in detail. The extra boundary condition and its associated artifacts can be circumvented by separating the reference waves from scattered wavefields prior to interferometry. Three wavefield-separation methods that can be used in interferometry are direct-wave interferometry, dual-field interferometry, and shot-domain separation. Each has different objectives and requirements.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'Seismic time migration is known for its ability to generate well-focused and interpretable images, based on a velocity field specified in the time domain. A fundamental requirement of this time-migration velocity field is that lateral variations are small. In the case of 3D time migration for symmetric elementary waves (e.g., primary PP reflections/diffractions, for which the incident and departing elementary waves at the reflection/diffraction point are pressure [P] waves), the time-migration velocity is a function depending on four variables: three coordinates specifying a trace point location in the time-migration domain and one angle, the so-called migration azimuth. Based on a time-migration velocity field available for a single azimuth, we have developed a method providing an image-ray transformation between the time-migration domain and the depth domain. The transformation is obtained by a process in which image rays and isotropic depth-domain velocity parameters for their propagation are esti-mated simultaneously. The depth-domain velocity field and image-ray transformation generated by the process have useful applications. The estimated velocity field can be used, for example, as an initial macrovelocity model for depth migration and tomographic inversion. The image-ray transformation provides a basis for time-to-depth conversion of a complete time-migrated seismic data set or horizons interpreted in the time-migration domain. This time-to-depth conversion can be performed without the need of an a priori known velocity model in the depth domain. Our approach has similarities as well as differences compared with a recently published method based on knowledge of time-migration velocity fields for at least three migration azimuths. We show that it is sufficient, as a minimum, to give as input a time-migration velocity field for one azimuth only. A practical consequence of this simplified input is that the image-ray transformation and its corresponding depth-domain velocity field can be generated more easily.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'Wavefield extrapolation in depth, a vital component of wave-equation depth migration, is accomplished by repeatedly applying a mathematical operator that propagates the wavefield across a single depth step, thus creating a depth marching scheme. The phase-shift method of wavefield extrapolation is fast and stable; however, it can be cumbersome to adapt to lateral velocity variations. We address the extension of phase-shift extrapolation to lateral velocity variations by using a spatial Gabor transform instead of the normal Fourier transform. The Gabor transform, also known as the windowed Fourier transform, is applied to the lateral spatial coordinates as a windowed discrete Fourier transform where the entire set of windows is required to sum to unity. Within each window, a split-step Fourier phase shift is applied. The most novel element of our algorithm is an adaptive partitioning scheme that relates window width to lateral velocity gradient such that the estimated spatial positioning error is bounded below a threshold. The spatial positioning error is estimated by comparing the Gabor method to its mathematical limit, called the locally homogeneous approximation \\u2014 a frequency-wavenumber-dependent phase shift that changes according to the local velocity at each position. The assumption of local homogeneity means this position-error estimate may not hold strictly for large scattering angles in strongly heterogeneous media. The performance of our algorithm is illustrated with imaging results from prestack depth migration of the Marmousi data set. With respect to a comparable space-frequency domain imaging method, the proposed method improves images while requiring roughly 50% more computing time.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'Time-lapse monitoring is a powerful tool for tracking subsurface changes resulting from fluid migration. Conventional time-lapse monitoring can be done by observing differences between two seismic surveys over the surveillance period. Along with the changes in the subsurface, differences in the two seismic surveys are also caused by variations in the near-surface overburden and acquisition discrepancies. The virtual-source method monitors below the time-varying near-surface by redatuming the data down to the subsurface receiver locations. It crosscorrelates the signal that results from surface shooting recorded by subsurface receivers placed below the near-surface. For the Mars field data, redatuming the recorded response down to the permanently placed ocean-bottom cable (OBC) receivers using the virtual-source method allows one to reconstruct a survey as if virtualsources were buried at the OBC receiver locations and the medium above them were a homogeneous half-space. Separating the recorded wavefields into upgoing and downgoing (up-down) waves before crosscorrelation makes the resultant virtual-source data independent of the time-varying near-surface (seawater). For time-lapse monitoring, varying source signature for the two surveys and for each shot is also undesirable. Deconvolving the prestack crosscorrelated data (correlation gather) by the power spectrum of the source-time function results in virtual-source data independent of the source signature. Incorporating up-down wavefield separation and deconvolution of the correlation gather by the source power spectrum into the virtual-source method suppresses the causes of nonrepeatability in the seawater along with acquisition and source signature discrepancies. This processing combination strengthens the virtual-source method for time-lapse monitoring.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'We describe a new shortcut strategy for imaging the sediments and salt edge around a salt flank through an overburden salt canopy. We tested its performance and capabilities on 2D synthetic acoustic seismic data from a Gulf of Mexico style model. We first redatumed surface shots, using seismic interferometry, from a walkaway vertical seismic profile survey as if the source and receiver pairs had been located in the borehole at the positions of the receivers. This process creates effective downhole shot gathers by completely moving surface shots through the salt canopy, without any knowledge of overburden velocity structure. After redatuming, we can apply multiple passes of prestack migration from the reference datum of the bore-hole. In our example, first-pass migration, using only a simple vertical velocity gradient model, reveals the outline of the salt edge. A second pass of reverse-time, prestack depth migration using full two-way wave equation was performed with an updated velocity model that consisted of the velocity gradient and salt dome. The second-pass migration brings out dipping sediments abutting the salt flank because these reflectors were illuminated by energy that bounced off the salt flank, forming prismatic reflections. In this target-oriented strategy, the computationally fast redatuming process eliminates the need for the traditional complex process of velocity estimation, model building, and iterative depth migration to remove effects of the salt canopy and surrounding overburden. This might allow this strategy to be used in the field in near real time.'],\n",

When inverting time-lapse ERT data, it is useful to proceed beyond straightforward inversion of data differences and take advantage of the time-lapse nature of the data. We assess various approaches for inverting and interpreting time-lapse ERT data and determine that two approaches work well. The first approach is model subtraction after separate inversion of the data from two time periods, and the second approach is to use the inverted model from a base data set as the reference model or prior information for subsequent time periods. We prefer this second approach. Data inversion methodology should be consideredwhen designing data acquisition; i.e., to utilize the second approach, it is important to collect one or more data sets for which the bulk of the subsurface is in a background or relatively unperturbed state. A third and commonly used approach to time-lapse inversion, inverting the difference between two data sets, localizes the regions of the model in which change has occurred; however, varying noise levels between the two data sets can be problematic. To further assess the various time-lapse inversion approaches, we acquired field data from a catchment within the Dry Creek Experimental Watershed near Boise, Idaho, U.S.A.

Removing high-frequency noise while preserving the high-frequency real signal is one of the most challenging tasks associated with gravity gradiometry data processing. We present a method to reduce gravity and gravity gradient data noise when both are measured in the same area, based on a least-squares simultaneous inversion of observations and physical constraints, inferred from the gravity gradient tensor definition and its mathematical properties. Instead of handling profiles individually, our noise-reduction method uses simultaneously measured values of the tensor components and of gravity in the whole survey area, benefiting from all available information. Synthetic examples show that more than half of the random noise can be removed from all tensor components and nearly all the noise from the gravity anomaly without altering the high-frequency information.

To achieve this, we develop a new algorithm that solves Poisson\\u2019s equation using the FE and FD approaches. We simulate topographic effects in the modeling algorithm using three FE approaches and two alternative FD approaches in which the air portion of the mesh is represented by very resistive cells. In both methods, we use rectangular and triangular discretization. Furthermore, we account for topographic effects by distorting the FE mesh with respect to the topography. We compare all methods for accuracy and calculation time on models with varying surface geometry and resistivity distributions. Comparisons show that model responses are similar when high-resistivity values are assigned to the top half of the rectangular cells at the air/earth boundary with the FE and FD methods and when the FE mesh is distorted. This result supports the idea that topographic effects can be incorporated into the forward solution by using the FD method; in some cases, this method also shortens calculation times.

       " {u'abstract': [u'We introduce a new finite-element-based scheme for the fast nonlinear inversion of large 3D geoelectric data sets acquired around isolated objects or across the earth\\u2019s surface. The principal novelty of this scheme is the combination of a versatile finite-element approach with (1) a method involving minimization of an objective function using a conjugate-gradient algorithm that includes an adjoint-field technique for efficiently establishing the objective-function gradient and (2) parabolic interpolation for estimating suitable inversion step lengths. This scheme is capable of handling large volumes of data acquired using diverse electrode configurations located around or across 3D structures. Only three solutions to the forward problem are required for each iteration. Computation of the Jacobian matrix, which might require computers with a large amount of memory, is not necessary. To minimize artificial irregularities in the inverted models, particularly near the electrodes, we smooth the model parametersafter each iteration. By including the influence of a reference model in the objective function, a priori information can be incorporated in the inversion process. Our new scheme is tested successfully on synthetic data generated for current and potential electrodes distributed around the surface of a complex object of finite extent. We also demonstrate the utility of the new scheme on geoelectric data acquired around a laboratory-scale object. Tomographic inversion of the 52,272 simulated voltage values in terms of an 8775-element model requires less than 45 minutes on a relatively slow Sun workstation. For the inversion of the 1016 observed voltage values in terms of an 81,480-element model, approximately 60 minutes of computer time is required. The rapid and flexible inversion scheme opens up new possibilities for resistivity imaging in geology, hydrology, engineering, nondestructive testing, and even biology and medicine, fields of study in which finite-element models are already used to represent complicated targets.'],\n",

Conductivity-depth imaging (CDI) is a useful tool for mapping the distribution of geologic conductivity and for identifying conductive targets. A CDI algorithm for HTEM systems with a concentric coil configuration is developed based on the pseudolayer half-space model. Primary advantages of this model are immunity to altimeter errors and better resolution of conductive layers than other half-space models. Effective depth is derived empirically from the diffusion depth and apparent thickness of the pseudolayer. A table lookup procedure is established based on the analytic solution of a half-space model to speed up processing. This efficiency makes generation of real-time conductivity-depth images possible. Tests on synthetic data demonstrate that the pseudolayer conductivity-depth-imaging algorithm maps a wider range of conduc-tivities and does a better job of resolving highly conductive layers, compared with that of the homogeneous half-space model. Effective depths are close to true depths in many circumstances. Field examples show stable and geologically meaningful conductivity-depth images.'],\n",

The constraints are built using Delaunay triangulation, which ensures automatic adaptation to data density variations. Model parameter information migrates horizontally through spatial constraints, increasing the resolution of layers that would be poorly resolved locally. SCI produces laterally smooth results with sharp layer boundaries that respect the 3D geological variations of sedimentary settings.

This waveform has the advantage of transferring maximum energy to the subsurface because the transmitter current is running at its peak amplitude at all times. However, a limitation of the square wave is that most of the transmitted energy is in the first harmonic. Processing methods such as depth migration and inversion have shown improved results if a transmitter waveform with substantial amounts of energy at multiple frequencies is used. We propose a method for designing transmitter waveforms where current amplitudes as a function of frequency can have an approximate predefined or desired distribution. At the same time, we require that the transmitter operate at its peak current at all times to maximize the energy transferred to the subsurface. To obtain the desired current spectra, the number of switching times in a period is allowed to be larger than two, which is the number of switching times per period for a standard square wave. The method is based on matching the desired frequency spectra with the spectra obtained from these generalized square waves. This optimization problem is solved by a Monte Carlo method.

However, in many cases, the quality of data is so poor that quantitative interpretation is not justified. This is because the small-loop EM method is required to detect very weak signals (the secondary magnetic fields) in the presence of the dominant primary field, so the data are inherently susceptible to calibration errors. Although these errors can be measured by raising the instrument high above the ground so that the effect of the conducting ground is negligible, it is impracticable to do so for every survey. We have developed an algorithm that simultaneously inverts small-loop EM data for a multidimensional resistivity distribution and offset errors. For this inversion method to work successfully the data must be collected at two heights. The forward modeling used in the inversion is based on a staggered-grid 3D finite-difference method; its solution has been checked against a 2.5D finite-element solution. Synthetic and real data examples demonstrate that the inversion recovers reliable resistivity models from multifrequency data that are contaminated severely by offset errors.'],\n",

Since development began in 1997, more than 650 billion liters of water have been produced from approximately 22,000 wells. Infiltration impoundments are used widely to dispose of by-product water from coal bed natural gas (CBNG) production, but their hydrogeologic effects are poorly understood. Helicopter electromagnetic surveys (HEM) were completed in July 2003 and July 2004 to characterize the hydrogeology of an alluvial aquifer along the Powder River. The aquifer is receiving CBNG produced water discharge from infiltration impoundments. HEM data were subjected to Occam\\u2019s inversion algorithms to determine the aquifer bulk conductivity, which was then correlated towater salinity using site-specific sampling results. The HEM data provided high-resolution images of salinity levels in the aquifer, a result not attainable using traditional sampling methods. Interpretation of these images reveals clearly the produced water influence on aquifer water quality. Potential shortfalls to this method occur where there is no significant contrast in aquifer salinity and infiltrating produced water salinity and where there might be significant changes in aquifer lithology. Despite these limitations, airborne geophysical methods can provide a broadscale (watershed-scale) tool to evaluate CBNG water disposal, especially in areas where field-based investigations are logistically prohibitive.

Previous RWE implementations assume that coordinate systems are defined by either orthogonal or semiorthogonal geometry. This restriction leads to situations where coordinate meshes suffer from problematic bunching and singularities. Nonorthogonal RWE is a procedure that avoids many of these problems by posing wavefield extrapolation on smooth, but generally nonorthogonal and singularity-free, coordinate meshes. The resulting extrapolation operators include additional terms that describe nonorthogonal propagation. These extra degrees of complexity, however, are offset by smoother coefficients that are more accurately implemented in one-way extrapolation operators. Remaining coordinate mesh singularities are then eliminated using a differential mesh smoothing procedure. Analytic extrapolation examples and the numerical calculation of 2D and 3D Green\\u2019s functions for cylindrical and near-spherical geometry validate the nonorthogonal RWE propagation theory.

       " {u'abstract': [u'The simulation of migrated and inverted data is hampered by the high computational cost of generating 3D synthetic data, followed by processes of migration and inversion. For example, simulating the migrated seismic signature of subtle stratigraphic traps demands the expensive exercise of 3D forward modeling, followed by 3D migration of the synthetic seismograms. This computational cost can be overcome using a strategy for simulating migrated and inverted data by filtering a geologic model with 3D spatial-resolution and angle filters, respectively. A key property of the approach is this: The geologic model that describes a target zone is decoupled from the macrovelocity model used to compute the filters. The process enables a target-orientedapproach, by which a geologically detailed earth model describing a reservoir is adjusted without having to recalculate the filters. Because a spatial-resolution filter combines the results of the modeling and migration operators, the simulated images can be compared directly to a real migration image. We decompose the spatial-resolution filter into two parts and show that applying one of those parts produces output directly comparable to 1D inverted real data. Two-dimensional synthetic examples that include seismic uncertainties demonstrate the usefulness of the approach. Results from a real data example show that horizontal smearing, which is not simulated by the 1D convolution model result, is essential to understand the seismic expression of the deformation related to sulfate dissolution and karst collapse.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'The fidelity of depth seismic imaging depends on the accuracy of the velocity models used for wavefield reconstruction. Models can be decomposed in two components, corresponding to large-scale and small-scale variations. In practice, the large-scale velocity model component can be estimated with high accuracy using repeated migration/tomography cycles, but the small-scale component cannot. When the earth has significant small-scale velocity components, wavefield reconstruction does not completely describe the recorded data, and migrated images are perturbed by artifacts. There are two possible ways to address this problem: (1) improve wavefield reconstruction by estimating more accurate velocity models and image using conventional techniques (e.g., wavefield crosscorrelation) or (2) reconstruct wavefields with conventional methods using the known background velocity model but improve the imaging condition to alleviate the artifacts caused by the imprecise reconstruction. Wedescribe the unknown component of the velocity model as a random function with local spatial correlations. Imaging data perturbed by such random variations is characterized by statistical instability, i.e., various wavefield components image at wrong locations that depend on the actual realization of the random model. Statistical stability can be achieved by preprocessing the reconstructed wavefields prior to the imaging condition. We use Wigner distribution functions to attenuate the random noise present in the reconstructed wavefields, parameterized as a function of image coordinates. Wavefield filtering using Wigner distribution functions and conventional imaging can be lumped together into a new form of imaging condition that we call an interferometric imaging condition because of its similarity to concepts from recent work on interferometry. The interferometric imaging condition can be formulated both for zero-offset and for multioffset data, leading to robust, efficient imaging procedures that effectively attenuate imaging artifacts caused by unknown velocity models.'],\n",

We study how curvelets are distorted after demigration followed by migration in a different velocity model. We show that for small local velocity perturbations, the demigration/migration is reduced to a simple morphing of the initial curvelet. The derivation of the expected curvature of the curvelets shows that it is easier to sparsify the demigration/migration operator than the migration operator. An application on a 2D synthetic data set, generated in a smooth heterogeneous velocity model and with a complex reflectivity, demonstrates the usefulness of curvelets to predict what a migrated image would become in a locally different velocity model without the need for remigrating the full input data set. Curvelets are thus well suited to study the sensitivity of a prestack depth-migrated image with respect to the heterogeneous velocity model used for migration.'],\n",

The hybrid method can suppress an additional solution that exists in the VTI acoustic wave equation, and it offers speed and other advantages over conventional FFD or FD methods alone. The algorithm is tested on a synthetic model involving log data from onshore eastern Saudi Arabia, including estimates of both intrinsic and layer-induced VTI parameters.

We extend our method to encompass a generalized reflectivity series represented by a summation of impulse pairs. Application of our spectral inversion to seismic data sets from the Gulf of Mexico results in reliable well ties to seismic data, accurate prediction of layer thickness to less than half the tuning thickness, and improved imaging of subtle stratigraphic features. Comparisons between well ties for spectrally inverted data and ties for conventional seismic data illustrate the superior resolution of the former. Several stratigraphic examples illustrate the various destructive effects of the wavelet, including creating illusory geologic information, such as false stratigraphic truncations that are related to lateral changes in rock properties, and masking geologic information, such as updip limits of thin layers.

       " {u'abstract': [u'The generalized sampling expansion is a method that can be used to combine gravity and gravity gradient data so that the line spacing of a survey can be increased without introducing aliasing into the measured signal. This reduces acquisition costs because the costs of shipborne and airborne gravity and gravity gradient surveys are related to the line spacing of the survey. The generalized sampling expansion combines the Fourier spectra of several undersampled gravity and gravity gradient data sets to produce an unaliased result. To achieve that result, input data are assumed to be noise free, infinite in extent, regularly sampled, and band limited. Deviations from this ideal induce errors, but these can be alleviated to a degree. In theory, the generalized sampling expan-sion can reconstruct an unaliased signal sampled at three times conventional line spacing. Unfortunately, edge effects and the presence of noise limit the practical increase in line spacing to twice normal line spacing. Six methods, each using different gradient components, can be used to achieve this doubling of line spacing. Edge effects introduce short-wavelength errors into several possible applications of the generalized sampling expansion, a problem that can be reduced by filtering the output of an expansion and by trimming away residual errors at its boundary. When applied to a deliberately decimated data set derived from data collected over the Cannington ore deposit in Australia, the generalized sampling expansion method successfully reduced aliasing in the signal and produced a more accurate interpolation than was obtained with a gradient-enhanced Akima spline method.'],\n",

Multiple survey lines can be tied together by collecting data along intersecting transects and enforcing Kirchhoff\\u2019s voltage law, which requires that the total potential drop around any closed loop equals zero. In practice, however, there is often a nonzero loop-closure error caused by noisy data; traditional SP processing methods redistribute this error evenly over the measurements that form each loop. The task of distributing errors and tying lines together becomes nontrivial when many lines of data form multiple interconnected loops because the loop-closure errors are not independent, and a unique potential field cannot be determined by processing lines sequentially. We present a survey-consistent processing method that produces a unique potential field by minimizing the loop-closure errors over all lines of data simultaneously.

       " {u'abstract': [u'This research provides an empirical study of electrodes used to measure galvanic resistivity. The central element of this work is an estimation of errors in resistivity measurements that arise because of the type of electrode material used. Fourteen types of electrodes were tested including metal electrodes, metal-salt-compound (nonpolarizing) electrodes, and one nonmetal electrode, under conditions that are typical of those encountered during geophysical surveys. Measurement errors for resistance and chargeability were estimated using the reciprocity of data from an array of electrodes such as might be used for electric-resistance tomography. The same error analysis was applied to data from a network of high-precision resistors to separate instrument errors from electrode errors. Significant differences were observed in errors produced by different electrode materials. We conclude that the choice of electrode is very important for resistivity or chargeability surveys. Iron, steel (including rebar), lead, and phosphor bronze produced the smallest errors in resistance and chargeability. Aluminum, magnesium, titanium, copper, and zinc produced the largest errors. Stainless steel (alloy 316), tin, and brass performed reasonably well, as did carbon, which was the only nonmetal tested.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'We present a new application of a focusing regularization scheme for the inversion of resistivity and induced polarization (IP) data that supports large resistivity magnitude and phase contrasts. Similar approaches so far have only been used for the interpretation of gravity, magnetic, or seismic data sets. Unlike methods based on smoothness constraints, the approach is able to resolve sharp boundaries of bodies and layers, and it allows slight parameter variations within them. Therefore, it can be used in hydrogeologic applications where we need focused images to resolve high-contrast aquifer boundaries. Our approach is based on the minimum gradient support, which seeks to minimize the occurrence of parameter contrasts, independent of their magnitude. We study the effects of a variable control parameter on the reweighting optimization, allowing a continuous transition from smooth to sharp images. We also take the spatially varying sensitivity into account to allow focusing even where sensitivities are small. The implemented weighting leads to increased smoothing in well-resolved areas and a decrease in regions of lower sensitivity. The opposite approach is examined as well. This gradient-dependent sensitivity weighting is basically an extension of depth-dependent sensitivity weighting. We demonstrate the effectiveness and limitations of the approach and the influence of the control parameter using different synthetic models and field data from a hydrogeophysical test site. The technique has proven particularly suitable for revealing sharp parameter contrasts.'],\n",

We compare three effective medium models: Berryman\\u2019s self-consistent model, the isoframe model, and the bounding-average method (BAM). The self-consistent model is used with two combinations of aspect ratios. In one combination, the aspect ratio is equal for pores and grains. In the other combination, the aspect ratio for grains is kept constant close to 1 and the aspect ratio for pores varies. All the models include one free parameter that determines the stiffness of the rock for a fixed porosity. This free parameter is compared with Biot\\u2019s coefficient to discuss whether the free parameter is related to pore-space compressibility for North Sea chalk.

When these conditions are not met, non-Archie electrical behavior arises whereby relationships among rock resistivity, porosity, and water saturation no longer exhibit power-law dependence. Currently, such an unreliable behavior of empirical laws can be quantified only through pore-scale modeling of electrical conductivity under specific sets of geometric assumptions and with substantial computation memory requirements. We introduce a new geometric concept to simulate direct-current electrical-conductivity phenomena in arbitrary rock models on the basis of 3D grain and pore objects that include explicit distributions of intragranular porosity, clay-exchange cations, nonwetting fluid blobs, thin films, and pendular rings. These objects are distributed in the pore space following simple heuristic principles of drainage/imbibition that honorcapillary-pressure curves. They provide a simple way to parameterize the 3D pore space and to calculate the electrical conductivity of porous media saturated with two immiscible fluid phases by way of diffusive random walks within the brine-filled pore space. Not only is the random-walk method memory efficient but it also allows the inclusion of clay/brine cation exchange surfaces otherwise not possible with conventional pore-network models. By comparing results stemming from random-walk, pore-network, and percolation simulations, we show the importance of grain surface roughness and thin film thickness, even in water-wet rocks where those factors usually are neglected. For the case of strongly oil-wet rocks, we show that thin films, snap-offs, and pore microgeometry have a primary impact on hysteresis-dominated rock resistivity during imbibition (increasing water saturation). Our simulation method agrees well overall with percolation simulation results and is advantageously unaffected by assumptions concerning site-percolation imbibition.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'The Gray Fossil Site, Washington County, Tennessee, has produced a remarkable Mio-Pliocene fauna and flora with no known correlative in the Appalachian region. After its discovery in 2000, a series of auger holes were drilled by the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) to determine the areal extent of the site. Drilling indicated that the fossils occurred in fill material within a paleokarst basin, but the distribution of boreholes does not permit details of sinkhole topography, and therefore its formation and fill history, to be adequately resolved. To better image the sinkhole basin, a high-resolution gravity survey, which included 1104 gravity measurement stations, was conducted. These data were used to create complete Bouguer and residual gravity anomaly maps and a 3D density model via inversionmethods. The residual gravity anomaly map compares favorably with 29 TDOT auger holes drilled to basement, but contains significantly more detail. The residual gravity anomaly map reveals the presence of seven separate sinkholes. However, 3D inverse modeling constrained by drill-hole depths and density data indicates that there are 11 separate sinkholes formed within the Knox Group carbonates. These sinkholes, which range between 20 and  ',\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'Three-dimensional ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data are routinely acquired for diverse geologic, hydrogeologic, archeological, and civil engineering purposes. Interpretations of these data are invariably based on subjective analyses of reflection patterns. Such analyses are heavily dependent on interpreter expertise and experience. Using data acquired across gravel units overlying the Alpine Fault Zone in New Zealand, we demonstrate the utility of various geometric attributes in reducing the subjectivity of 3D GPR data analysis. We use a coherence-based technique to compute the coherency, azimuth, and dip attributes and a gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) method to compute the texture-based energy, entropy, homogeneity, and contrast attributes. A selection of the GPR attribute volumes allows us to highlightkey aspects of the fault zone and observe important features not apparent in the standard images. This selection also provides information that improves our understanding of gravel deposition and tectonic structures at the study site. A new depositional/structural model largely based on the results of our analysis of GPR attributes includes four distinct gravel units deposited in three phases and a well-defined fault trace. This fault trace coincides with a zone of stratal disruption and shearing bound on one side by upward-tilted to synclinally folded stratified gravels and on the other side by moderately dipping stratified alluvial-fan gravels that could have been affected by lateral fault drag. When used in tandem, the coherence- and texture-based attribute volumes can significantly improve the efficiency and quality of 3D GPR interpretation, especially for complex data collected across active fault zones.'],\n",

To illustrate this effect, a near-surface CMP seismic reflection survey was conducted using two sources to compare the effects of various band-pass frequency filters on clipped traces. An event observed in the clipped data set replicated the frequency of the filter operators applied, similar to the effect of convolving a boxcar function with the filter operator. The anomaly exhibited hyperbolic moveout and imitated a reflection during the processing stages. The hyperbolic event was flattened by NMO corrections chosen for the target reflection, and it stacked in as a coherent event in the final section.

This approach avoids mixing the typically weaker side-scattered energy with the stronger in-plane reflections, thereby providing greater leverage in identifying image contributions from out-of-the-plane steeply dipping reflectors, fractures and faults. We examine the impact of this new imaging approach combined with analysis of seismic attributes that have proved useful for fracture detection, on data from the Fort Worth Basin, Texas, United States.

Stepping away from wavelike approaches, which if applied without care can be misleading for the diffusive fields of CSEM, we demonstrate an effective way to mitigate the effect of the air in shallow water surveys by decomposing the EM signal into modes and using only the mode least affected by interaction with the atmosphere. Such decomposition is straightforward in a 1D earth, and we demonstrate that the approach remains valid in higher dimensional structures.

The total field is then the sum of the analytical background field calculated with a 1D modeling method and the difference or scattered field mentioned above. Compared with a conventional direct solution (using delta sources directly in a 2.5D formulation), the new method has smaller near-field error as a result of the source singularity and smaller boundary reflections. The new method does not require a dense mesh in the source region, which thereby reduces the total number of variables to be solved.

Problems are amplified by reliance on a few complex wells with sophisticated sand-control media. New downhole data are required for better understanding and prevention of production impairment. We introduce real-time completion monitoring (RTCM), a new nonintrusive surveillance method that uses acoustic signals sent via the fluid column to identify permeability impairment in sand-screened completions. The signals are carried by tube waves that move borehole fluid back and forth radially across the completion layers. Such tube waves are capable of instant testing of the presence or absence of fluid communication across the completion and are sensitive to changes occurring in sand screens, gravel sand, perforations, and possibly in the reservoir. The part of the completion that has different impairment from its neighbors will carry tube waves with modified signatures (velocity, attenuation) and will produce a reflection from the boundary where impairment changes. We conduct a laboratory experiment with a model of a completed horizontal borehole and focus on effects of sand-screen permeability on transmitted and reflected acoustic signatures.

At the same time, theoretical analysis shows that for an idealized monomineral rock, the effective stress coefficient for elastic moduli (and therefore also for seismic velocities) will always equal one.

Resistivity maps at different depths map the fault as a narrow, linear, lateral resistivity gradient matching the anomalies observed with other techniques. This method proved to be efficient in determining the precise position and orientation of dip-slip faults, and could potentially be very useful for the identification of lateral changes in fault geometry, such as splays and step-overs. Subsequent trenching confirmed the presence of a normal fault at the location predicted by the geophysical survey.

In the transition zone surrounding the core, a water-content minimum and other changes contribute to a deeper GPR signal penetration that highlights dipping events.

Defining these two attributes in this way permits complex seismic trace analysis to be founded without reference to the complex trace.

The detection of the spikes\\u2019 time lags is a highly nonlinear optimization problem that can be solved using very fast simulated annealing (SA).

Further, errors in the phase of the wavelet estimate are tolerated, for an optimum constant-phase shift is obtained to calibrate the effective wavelet that is present in the data.

This transformation is calculated using map migration, which employs the local slopes from the curvelet decomposition of the data. Because the data can be compressed using curvelets, the transformation needs to be calculated for relatively few curvelets only. Numerical examples for homogeneous media show that using the leading-order approximation only provides a good approximation to CO migration for moderate propagation times.

Forward modeling is either a finite-difference solver of the full acoustic wave equation or a one-way wave-equation solver that correctly models the amplitudes. The modified imaging principle provides better amplitude estimates of the impedance contrasts and does not suffer from the artifacts at-tributable to diving waves, which can be seen in two-way, least-squares migrated sections.

       " {u'abstract': [u'Conventional Kirchhoff migration can be made much faster by a priori calculation of wave arrival directions, and tracing rays back only along the measured directions; this is known as parsimonious migration. For surface seismic data, where acquisition with 2D arrays is common, the wave arrival directions can be measured by using local slant stacking to calculate the two horizontal slowness components. The vertical slowness is then deduced by using the dispersion relation. For vertical seismic profile (VSP) data, where multiline acquisition is not possible, only the vertical component of the slowness vector can be measured, which is insufficient to constrain the wave arrival direction. We overcome this limitation for three-component VSP data by polarization analysis of the incident waves. Polar and azimuth anglesare calculated at the receivers by estimating the data covariance matrix and the vertical slowness, assuming isotropic media and linear polarization of both P- and S-waves. For P-waves, the data covariance matrix defines the polarization ellipsoid, which is then used to calculate the wave arrival direction. For S-waves, an additional step is required because the polarization is orthogonal to the propagation direction. Ray tracing along only the measured propagation directions eliminates the traditional traveltime table calculation, and enhances the efficiency of Kirchhoff migration of three-component VSP data. Distortions of the polarization caused by factors such as anisotropy are assumed to be corrected independently of the migration process described here.

The Hadamard transform is particularly good at finding repeating, stacked vertical sequences. Crossplot analysis indicates translation-invariant attributes for horizon-based time windows are less sensitive to horizon interpretation errors in the reservoir interval. Therefore, translation-invariant attributes can be used to find a particular geologic pattern of interest in a reservoir interval. These attributes have been applied successfully to discriminate the lithofacies in a reservoir interval of interest for a 3D seismic survey in the upper Assam basin of India. The sand-shale thickness ratio at the drilled locations within the reservoir interval is used to define the lithofacies categories. Using the discriminant function analysis of each of the conventional-seismic, principal-component, and translation-invariant sets of attributes, we create a corresponding discriminant score map.

We combine within an integrated formulation the geophysical and petrophysical components of the problem to estimate the elastic and reservoir properties jointly. We solve the inverse problem following a Monte Carlo sampling approach, which allows us to quantify the uncertainties of the reservoir estimates accounting for the combination of geophysical data uncertainties, the deviations of the elastic properties from the calibrated petrophysical transform, and the nonlinearity of the geophysical and petrophysical relations. We implement this method for the inference of the total porosity and the acoustic impedance in a reservoir area, combining petrophysical and seismic information. In our formulation, the porosity and impedance are related with a statistical model based on the Wyllie transform calibrated to well-log data.

       " {u'abstract': [u'Besides field applications to geophysical prospecting and subsurface hydrology, electrical resistivity tomography can be applied to finite-scale blocks in the laboratory to characterize the resistivity structure of the blocks and to monitor internal physical and chemical processes. This requires a fast and accurate calculation of the sensitivity matrix to perform a successful resistivity inversion for such blocks. However, the complex geometric shape and boundary and the finite size of the block limit the application of field-suitable sensitivity calculation methods to these blocks. As blocks and finite columns are often used in the laboratory experiments, this paper develops practical analytic expressions, based on the method of image charges, for the sensitivity matrix for these two types of homogenous bodies. The corresponding formulae for the electric potential distribution and theelectrode array coefficient are also presented. As a result of the theory, the effects of placing limits on the sum index in the electric-potential calculation can be analyzed, and a comparison of the theoretical and the numerically simulated electric potential is shown. The results demonstrate the correctness of the theory and indicate that even the addition of only one set of mirror current sources greatly reduces the effects of the block boundary on the electric-potential calculation. Finally, several interesting sensitivity distributions for cross-surface arrays on blocks, and for circular and vertical arrays on columns, are given. Although the formulae developed here are only valid for homogeneous blocks and columns, and an element of relatively small volume is required to permit a good approximation to the sensitivity, the theory is useful in the verification of numerically simulated results, in sensitivity-analysis for optimum probing-scheme design, and in successful resistivity inversion calculation for finite bodies.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'Long-offset or high-incident-angle seismic reflections provide us with improved velocity resolution, better leverage against multiples, less contamination by ground roll, and information that is often critical when estimating lithology and fluid product. Unfortunately, high-incident-angle seismic reflections suffer not only from nonhyperbolic moveout but also from wavelet stretch during imaging, resulting in lower-resolution images that mix the response from adjacent lithologies. For an arbitrary acoustic medium, wavelet stretch from prestack migration depends only on the cosine of the reflection angle, such that the amount of wavelet stretch will be the same for all samples of a common-reflection-angle migrated trace. Thus, we are able to implement a wavelet stretch correction by applying a simple stationary spectral shaping operation to common-angle migrated traces. We obtain such traces directly by a prestack Kirchhoff migration algorithm. Correcting for stretch effectively increases the fold of imaged data, far beyond that achieved in conventional migration, resulting in improved signal-to-noise ratio of the final stacked section. Increasing the fidelity of large incident angles results in images with improved vertical and lateral resolution and with increased angular illumination, valuable for amplitude variation with angle (AVA) and amplitude variation with offset (AVO) analysis. Finally, such large-angle images are more sensitive to and therefore provide increased leverage over errors in velocity and velocity anisotropy. These ideas were applied to prestack time migration on seismic data from the Fort Worth basin, in Texas.'],\n",

For the older eruptive periods, the locations of source vents and the extension of lava flows are either speculative or unknown, because they are buried under more recent pyroclastics. In this study, we used surface and subsurface backscatter characteristics of the P- and L-band polarimetric airborne synthetic aperture radar (AIRSAR) data and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) soundings to resolve different exposed and buried lava flows. Our primary objective is to define the most effective polarization and frequency for mapping, resolving, and characterizing different lava types in the volcanic field. Polarimetric analysis of AIRSAR images from COM allows a clear recognition of the aa and pahoehoe lava types as a result of the variability in their roughness. Our results suggest that the HV cross-polarized, AIRSAR L-band is capable of producing a detailed map delineating surface lava with different surface backscattering properties. An accuracy assessment utilizing the geological map of the Inferno Cone area was performed to quantify the reliability of differentiating lava types and mapping the lava flows extension below loose pyroclastics using AIRSAR data. Results shows an ability of P-band SAR to map buried structures up to 3 meters deep under loose cinder and ash deposits, resolving buried fissures, outcrops, and lava flows that were validated with ground-truth GPR surveys. The techniques used in this study provide a tool to assess volcanic hazards in remote and inaccessible places.

The gravity effect of mass deficit between the Cretaceous and Permian formations was found using 3D forward modeling and subsequently removed from the Bouguer gravity anomaly along with the regional gravity field. The modified residual gravity field was then subjected to3D inversion to map the variations in depth of the basement beneath the Permian sediments. Inversion of gravity data resulted in two basement ridges, running almost east to west, dividing the basin into three independent depressions.

The inferred 3D basement configuration of the basin clearly brought out the listric nature of these two faults.

Conventionally, the imaging condition indicates the presence of reflectors when propagation times of reflections in the source and receiver wavefields match. The main drawback of a conventional crosscorrelation imaging condition is that it ignores the local spatial coherence of reflection events and relies only on their propagation time. This leads to interference between unrelated events that occur at the same time. Sources of crosstalk include seismic events corresponding to different seismic experiments, propagation paths, types of reflections (primary or multiple), or wave modes (P or S). An alternative imaging condition operates on the same extrapolated wavefields, but crosscorrelation takes place in a higher-dimension domain where seismic events are separated based on their local space-time slope.

We derive the elastic tensor of a solid-saturated porous rock considering small deformations of the rock skeleton and the pore infill material upon loading them with the confining and pore-space stresses. In the case of isotropic material, the solution reduces to two generalized Gassmann equations for the bulk and shear moduli. The applicability of the new model is tested by independent numerical simulations performed on the microscale by finite-difference and finite-element methods. The results show very good agreement between the new theory and the numerical simulations. The generalized Gass-mann model introduces a new heuristic parameter, characterizing the elastic properties of average deformation of the pore-filling solid material. In many cases, these elastic moduli can be substituted by the elastic parameters of the infill grain material. They can also represent a proper viscoelastic model of the pore-filling material. Knowledge of the effective elastic properties for such a situation is required, for example, when predicting seismic velocities in some heavy oil reservoirs, where a highly viscous material fills the pores.

Modeling of elastic-wave propagation directly from rock microstructure is integral to this technology. We survey recent development of the rotated staggered grid (RSG) finite-difference (FD) method for pore-scale simulation of elastic wave propagation in digital rock samples, including the dynamic elastic properties of rocks saturated with a viscous fluid. Examination of the accuracy of this algorithm on models with known analytical solutions provide an additional accuracy condition for numerical modeling on the microscale. We use both the elastic and viscoelastic versions of the RSG algorithm to study gas hydrates and to simulate propagation of Biot\\u2019s slow wave. We applyRSG method ology to examine the effect of gas hydrate distributions in the pore space of a rock. We compare resulting P-wave velocities with experimentally measured data, as a basis for building an effective-medium model for rocks containing gas hydrates.

       " {u'abstract': [u'Of the key reservoir properties, permeability seems to be the most elusive. Since the middle of the 90s, various seismic attributes have been proposed to map permeability by using detailed analysis of the frequency content of reflected wavetrains. Some attributes are expected to show a relative increase of high-frequency content with increased permeability; other attributes assume the opposite. Actually, both these trends were observed. A possible explanation of these observations is here derived from an effective model of a permeable dual-porosity layer enclosed by impermeable rocks. For such a model, the reflected wavetrain can be regarded as a sum of three components, one of which is related to acoustic-impedance contrasts, another to extra compliance caused by P-wave-induced fluid flows between fractures and intergranular pores with a high aspect ratio, and a third to the fluid-flow-induced, inelastic attenuation. In layered reservoirs, all the components tend to be frequency dependent, and the well-known dependence of the first component on the reflecting-layer thickness may strongly dominate the effects of permeability. Hence, predicting the behavior of a permeability attribute in a particular environment requires a modeling formalism that can be called permeability substitution by analogy with the widely used fluid-substitution technique.'],\n",

When applied to seismic sections, the fundamental assumption is that primary reflections generally mimic stratigraphic timelines. The main objective of this study was to test how well key reflectors in a seismic section couple to timelines. To achieve the high level of ground control needed for such testing, we combined photogrammetry and traditional sedimentologic fieldwork to optimize the geologic model. We relied further on petrophysical analysis to derive a numerical model suitable for the simulation of seismic data. In spite of laterally discontinuous vertical-impedance contrasts (VICs), false seismic continuity was created, and we observed frequent decoupling of seismic reflectors and stratigraphic timelines. These observations demonstrate how the low-frequency seismic method fails to image normal complexity in a stratigraphic unit. A seismic correlation test showed that the interpreters made numerous mistakes and that such mistakes are very difficult to avoid. The failure of a fundamental assumption, as illustrated here, creates serious problems for the sequence stratigraphic concept when applied to detailed correlation analysis on seismic sections.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'Ray-based seismic modeling methods can be applied at various stages of the exploration and production process. The standard ray method has several advantages, e.g., computational efficiency and the possibility of simulating propagation of elementary waves. As a high-frequency approximation, the method also has a number of limitations, particularly with respect to a lack of amplitude reliability in the presence of rapid changes of the model functions representing elastic parameters and interfaces. Given the objective of improving the applicability of the standard ray method, we present a strategy that does not require specific extension to finite frequencies. Instead, we define each ray-based process as an element of a system that, as a composite process, is able to obtain better results than the ray-based process applied alone. Other elements of the composite process can be finite-difference modeling or numerical solutions for surface and volume integrals, which are basic constituents of Kirchhoff modeling and imaging. We also include among the process elements recently developed techniques for simulating the migration amplitude on a target reflector and in a local volume, e.g., a reservoir zone. The model is decomposed according to its complexity into volume elements, surface elements, or a combination. The composite process consists of a specified interaction between process elements and model elements, which fits well with the philosophy of modern software design. Model elements that will be exposed to ray-tracing algorithms may need appropriate preparation, e.g., smoothing and resampling. We demonstrate specifically, in a tutorial example, that simulating the seismic response from a reflector by ray-based composite processes can yield better results than applying standard ray tracing alone.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'We propose a simple acoustic model explaining the main features of gas chimneys. The main elements of the model consist of gas diffusing from a connected fracture network and into the surrounding shale creating an inhomogeneous gas saturation. The gas saturation results in an inhomogeneous fluctuating compressional velocity field that distorts seismic waves. We model the fracture network by a random-walk process constrained by maximum fracture length and angle of the fracture with respect to the vertical. The gas saturation is computed from a simple analytical solution of the diffusion equation, and pressure-wave velocities are locally obtained assuming that mixing of shale and gas occurs on a scale much smaller than seismic wavelengths. Synthetic seismic sections are then computed using the resulting inhomogeneous velocity model and shown to give rise to similar deterioration in data quality as that found in data from real gas chimneys. Also, synthetic common-midpoint (CMP) gathers show the same distorted and attenuated traveltime curves as those obtained from a real data set. The model shows clearly that the features of gas chimneys change with geological time (a model parameter in our approach), the deterioration of seismic waves being smallest just after the creation of the gas chimney. It seems likely that at least some of the features of gas chimneys can be explained by a simple elastic model in combination with gas diffusion from a fracture network.'],\n",

A simple model shows that the additional suppression of multiples in the case of WATS acquisition is the result of a natural weighting of the traces going into the stack due to the areal nature of the acquisition. This simple model also shows that the extent of the additional multiple suppression is strongly dependent on the acquisition effort. A sparse acquisition effort will result in little additional multiple suppression. The use of 3D SRME processing is shown to be more accurate in predicting multiples, given input data with multiple azimuths, compared to making similar predictions from narrow-azimuth data. Three-dimensional SRME has the potential to reduce the residual multiples to the same extent as WATS acquisition with a higher acquisition effort. A complex model demonstrates that WATS acquisition does reduce the multiple-generated noise in subsalt images, but 3D SRME processing further reduces the residual multiple noise. The use of 3D SRME may reduce the multiples more than that achieved by increasing the cable half-aperture in the WATS acquisition effort. Finally, ray trace modeling is used to investigate the effect of WATS acquisition on subsurface illumination for subsalt imaging. We show that narrow-azimuth acquisition produces irregularities in subsalt illumination perpendicular to the acquisition direction which are a potential cause of migration noise. WATS acquisition results in higher and more uniform subsalt illumination and, hence, improves the subsalt image by reducing subsalt migration noise.'],\n",

These two methods complement each other. Ocean-bottom receivers may be used effectively where field development has resulted in many obstacles that might interfere with towed-streamer methods, where the required size of the 3D survey is not too extensive, or where very long offsets are required for all azimuths.

The NPML formulation shows great advantages over the standard complex stretched coordinate PML.

The equivalence of the wave-absorbing performance between these two PML formulations (the standard complex stretched coordinate PML formulation and the NPML formulation) in 3D Cartesian coordinates for acoustic wave propagation modeling is proved mathematically in this work. In time-domain methods, the advantages of the NPML over the standard PML were explained by both the analytical analysis and the numerical simulations in terms of implementation simplicity and computational efficiency. The computation time saving is up to 17% for the 2D example used in this work. For 3D problems, this computational saving is more significant. After theoretically analyzing the numerical reflections from the NPML and the standard PML, we concluded that these two PML formulations have exactly the same performance, even after spatial discretization. This conclusion is validated by numerical experiment.

A new implementation has been developed for simulating elastic wave propagation in which the free-surface condition is replaced by an explicit acoustic-elastic boundary. Detailed comparisons of seismograms with different implementations for the air-earth boundary were undertaken using the (2,2) (the finite-difference operators are second order in time and space) and the (2,6) (second order in time and sixth order in space) standard staggered-grid (SSG) schemes. Methods used in these comparisons to define the air-earth boundary included the stress image method (SIM), the heterogeneous approach, the scheme of modifying material properties based on transversely isotropic medium approach, the acoustic-elastic boundary approach, and an analytical approach. The method proposed achieves the same or higher accuracy of modeled body waves relative to the SIM. Rayleigh waves calculated using the explicit acoustic-elastic boundary approach differ slightly from those calculated using the SIM. Numerical results indicate that when using the (2,2) SSG scheme for SIM and our new method, a spatial step of 16 points per minimum wavelength is sufficient to achieve 90% accuracy; 32 points per minimum wavelength achieves 95% accuracy in modeled Rayleigh waves. When using the (2,6) SSG scheme for the two methods, a spatial step of eight points per minimum wavelength achieves 95% accuracy in modeled Rayleigh waves. Our proposed method is physically reasonable and, based on dispersive analysis of simulated seismographs from a layered half-space model, is highly accurate.

       " {u'abstract': [u'Proper understanding of seismic emissions associated with the growth of complexly shaped microearthquake networks and larger-scale nonplanar fault ruptures, both in arbitrarily heterogeneous media, requires accurate modeling of the underlying dynamic processes. We present a new 3D dynamic-rupture, finite-difference model called the finite-difference, fault-element (FDFE) method; it simulates the dynamic rupture of nonplanar faults subjected to regional loads in complex media. FDFE is based on a 3D methodology for applying dynamic-rupture boundary conditions along the fault surface. The fault is discretized by a set of parallelepiped fault elements in which specific boundary conditions are applied. These conditions are applied to the stress tensor, once transformed into a local fault referenceframe. Numerically determined weight functions multiplying particle velocities around each element allow accurate estimates of fault kinematic parameters (i.e., slip and slip rate) independent of faulting mechanism. Assuming a Coulomb-like slip-weakening friction law, a parametric study suggests that the FDFE method converges toward a unique solution, provided that the cohesive zone behind the rupture front is well resolved (i.e., four or more elements inside this zone). Solutions are free of relevant numerical artifacts for grid sizes smaller than approximately  ',\n",

However, to retain computational efficiency, very high order polynomials cannot be used and errors such as numerical dispersion and numerical anisotropy cannot be totally avoided. In the present work, we devise an approach for reducing such errors by considering modified discrete wave operators. We analyze consistent and lumped operators together with blended operators (weighted averages of consistent and lumped operators). Furthermore, using the operator-blending approach and a novel dispersion analysis method, we develop optimal spectral-element operators that have increased numerical accuracy, without resorting to very high order operators. The new operators are faster and computationally more efficient than consistent operators. Our approach is based on the tensor product decomposition of the element matrices into 1D factors. We apply standard lumping to the factor associated with the 1D mass matrix. A simplified numerical dispersion analysis of arbitrary order and spatial dimension provides a practical criterion for weighting consistent and lumped matrices. The approach is general and is valid for solving both the time-dependent and the stationary (Helmholtz) wave equations.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'An explicit algorithm for the extrapolation of one-way wavefields is proposed that combines recent developments in information theory and theoretical signal processing with the physics of wave propagation. Because of excessive memory requirements, explicit formulations for wave propagation have proven to be a challenge in 3D. By using ideas from compressed sensing, we are able to formulate the (inverse) wavefield extrapolation problem on small subsets of the data volume, thereby reducing the size of the operators. Compressed sensing entails a new paradigm for signal recovery that provides conditions under which signals can be recovered from incomplete samplings by nonlinear recovery methods that promote sparsity of the to-be-recovered signal. According to this theory, signals can be successfully recovered when the measurement basis is incoherent with the representa-tion in which the wavefield is sparse. In this new approach, the eigenfunctions of the Helmholtz operator are recognized as a basis that is incoherent with curvelets that are known to compress seismic wavefields. By casting the wavefield extrapolation problem in this framework, wavefields can be successfully extrapolated in the modal domain, despite evanescent wave modes. The degree to which the wavefield can be recovered depends on the number of missing (evanescent) wavemodes and on the complexity of the wavefield. A proof of principle for the compressed sensing method is given for inverse wavefield extrapolation in 2D, together with a pathway to 3D during which the multiscale and multiangular properties of curvelets, in relation to the Helmholz operator, are exploited. The results show that our method is stable, has reduced dip limitations, and handles evanescent waves in inverse extrapolation.'],\n",

We show that the effective coefficients represent a generalization of the plane-wave coefficients widely used in conventional seismic modeling, even for the case of curved reflectors, nonplanar wavefronts, and finite frequencies. The proposed method is capable of producing complex wave phenomenas, such as caustics, edge diffractions, and head waves. Seismograms modeled for even simple models reveal significant errors implicit in the plane-wave approximation.

In this paper, we present a 3D wave-equation interferometric migration method that efficiently images VSP free-surface multiples. Synthetic and field data results confirm that a reflectivity image volume, comparable in size to a 3D surface seismic survey around the well, can be computed economically. The reflectivity image volume has less fold density and lower signal-to-noise ratio than that obtained by a conventional 3D surface seismic survey because of the relatively weak energy of multiples and the limited number of geophones in the well.

       " {u'abstract': [u'A site-specific rock-physics transform from porosity, mineralogy, and pore fluid to elastic-wave velocities is used to invert seismic amplitude data for clay content, total porosity, and saturation. The implementation is Bayesian and produces probabilistic values of the reservoir properties from seismic measurements and well data. This method focuses on an exploration setting where minimal data exist. Two key assumptions reduce the problem and keep the prior information as noncommittal as possible. First, a prior interpretation of the seismic data is required that provides a geobody on which to perform the inversion. Second, the reservoir thickness is assumed to be constant, as are the rock properties within the reservoir. The prior distributions of the reservoir properties are assumed to be uncorrelated and independent, although this is not an essential assumption. Central to theinversion is the generation of a complete set of earth models derived from the prior distribution. A site-specific rock-physics model translates these properties (clay content, porosity, and saturation) into the elastic domain. A complete set of forward seismic models accompanies the earth models, and these seismic models are compared to the real data on a trace-by-trace basis. The reservoir properties corresponding to the seismic models that match the real data within predefined errors are used to construct the posterior. This method was tested on well and seismic data from offshore western South Africa. Initial results at calibration and test wells indicate an overprediction of porosity and uncertain predictions of clay content and saturation. This is a result of the constant-thickness assumption. However, a highly negative correlation between porosity and thickness is predicted, which manifests the success of this method.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'The derivation of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) images in which the amplitudes of reflections and diffractions are consistent with subsurface electromagnetic property contrasts requires migration algorithms that correctly account for the antenna radiation patterns and the vectorial character of electromagnetic wavefields. Most existing vector-migration techniques are based on far-field approximations of Green\\u2019s functions, which are inappropriate for the majority of GPR applications. We have recently developed a method for rapidly computing practically exact-field Green\\u2019s functions in a multicomponent vector migration scheme. A significant disadvantage of this scheme is the extra effort needed to record, process, and migrate at least two components of GPR data. By making straightforward modifications to the multi-component algorithm, we derive an equivalent exact-field sin-gle-component vector-migration scheme that can be applied to most standard GPR data acquired using a single copolarized antenna pair. Our new formulation is valid for polarization-independent features (e.g., most point scatterers, spheres, and planar objects), but not for polarization-dependent ones (e.g., most underground public utilities). A variety of tests demonstrates the stability of the exact-field single-component operators. Applications of the new scheme to synthetic and field-recorded GPR data containing dipping planar reflections produce images that are virtually identical to the corresponding multicomponent vector-migrated images and are almost invariant to the relative orientations of antennas and reflectors. The new single-component vector-migration scheme is appropriate for migrating the majority of GPR data acquired by researchers and practitioners.'],\n",

Conventional tomograms provided by standard ray-based techniques have limited resolution, primarily because only a fraction of the information contained in the radar data (i.e., the first-arrival times and maximum first-cycle amplitudes) is included in the inversion. To increase the resolution of radar tomograms, we have developed a versatile full-waveform inversion scheme that is based on a finite-difference time-domain solution of Maxwell\\u2019s equations. This scheme largely accounts for the 3D nature of radar-wave propagation and includes an efficient method for extracting the source wavelet from the radar data. After demonstrating the potential of the new scheme on two realistic synthetic data sets, we apply it to two crosshole field data sets acquired in very different geologic/hydrogeologic environments. These are the first applications of full-waveform tomography to observed crosshole radar data. The resolution of all full-waveform tomograms is shown to be markedly superior to that of the associated ray tomograms. Small subsurface features a fraction of the dominant radar wavelength and boundaries between distinct geological/hydrological units are sharply imaged in the full-waveform tomograms.'],\n",

To do so, we model the slowness and attenuation covariance functions to generate geostatistical simulations that are conditional to the arrival times, amplitudes, slowness, and attenuation observed along boreholes. We combine slowness and attenuation fields to compute conductivity and permittivity fields from which we model synthetic radar traces using a finite-difference time-domain full-waveform algorithm. Modeled traces that best match the measured ones correspond to the computed conductivity and permittivity fields that correlate best with the true physical properties of the ground.

It is especially designed to benefit from the simultaneous use of all the FTG components and of the gravity field. In particular, it uses tensor scalar invariants as a basis for source location. The invariant expressions involve all of the independent components of the tensor. This method is a tensor analog of Euler deconvolution, but has the following advantages compared to the conventional Euler deconvolution method: (1) It provides a solution at every observation point, without the use of a sliding window. (2) It determines the structural index automatically; as a consequence, the structural index follows the variations of the field morphology. (3) It uses all components of the measured full gradient tensor and gravity field, thus reducing errors caused by random noise. It is based on scalar invariants that are by nature insensitive to the orientation of the measuring device. We tested our method on both noise-free and noise-contaminated data. These tests show that tensor solutions cluster in the vicinity of the center of causative bodies, whereas Euler solutions better outline their edges. Hence, these methods should be combined for improved contouring and depth estimation. In addition, we use a clustering method to improve the selection of solutions, which proves advantageous when data are noisy or when signals from close causative bodies interfere.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'Geologic noise and background electromagnetic (EM) waves often degrade the quality of very low frequency electromagnetic (VLF-EM) data. To retrieve signals with significant geologic information, we used a new nonlinear decomposition technique called the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method with the Hilbert transform. We conducted a 2D resistivity model study that included inversion of the synthetic data to test the accuracy and capabilities of this method. Next, we applied this method to real data obtained from a field experiment and a geologic example. The filtering procedure for real data starts with applying the EMD method to decompose the VLF data into a series of intrinsic mode functions that admit a well-behaved Hilbert transform. With the Hilbert transform, the intrinsic mode functions yielded a spectrogram that presents an energy-wavenumber-distance distribution of the VLF data. We then examined the decomposed data and their spectrogram to determine the noise components, which we eliminated to obtain more reliable VLF data. The EMD-filtered data and their associated spectrograms indicated the successful application of this method. Because VLF data are recorded as a complex function of the real variable distance, the in-phase and quadrature parts are complementary components of each other and could be a Hilbert transform pair if the data are analytical and noise free. Therefore, by comparing the original data set with the one obtained from the Hilbert transform, we could evaluate data quality and could even replace the original with its Hilbert transform counterpart with acceptable accuracy. By application of both this technique and conventional methods to real data in this study, we have shown the superiority of this new method and have obtained a more reliable earth model by inverting the EMD-filtered data.'],\n",

Based on the method of statistical smoothing applied to Biot\\u2019s equations of poroelasticity, we derive models for the dynamic-equivalent permeability in 1D and 3D randomly inhomogeneous media.

The resulting attenuation and dispersion model is confirmed by numerical computations in randomly layered poroelastic structures. The results suggest that the effect of wave-induced fluid flow can be observed in a broader frequency range than previously thought.

       "   u' ,  ',\n",
       "   u' , and  ',\n",
       "   u' . Whereas the first-order approximation for each parameter isgiven sim-ply by the volume-weighted average of its interval values, the second-order terms include coupling between various factors related to both heterogeneity and intrinsic anisotropy. Interestingly, the effective attenuation for P- and SV-waves is anisotropic even for a medium composed of isotropic layers with identical attenuation, provided there is a velocity variation among the constituent layers. Contrasts in the intrinsic attenuation, however, do not create attenuation anisotropy, unless they are accompanied by velocity contrasts. Extensive numerical testing shows that the second-order approximation for  ',\n",

       "   u'  is close to the exact solution for most plausible subsurface models. The accuracy of the first-order approximation depends on the magnitude of the quadratic terms, which is largely governed by the strength of the velocity (rather than attenuation) anisotropy and velocity contrasts. The effective attenuation parameters for multiconstituent VTI models vary within a wider range than do the velocity parameters, with almost equal probability of positive and negative values. If some of the constituents are azimuthally anisotropic with misaligned vertical symmetry planes, the effective velocity and attenuation functions may have different principal azimuthal directions or even different symmetries.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'The existing fracture-characterization techniques are based on assuming the unfractured host rock either to be isotropic or the magnitudes of both the background and crack-induced anisotropies to be small. I relax both assumptions and examine the effective media caused by fractures with realistic (not small) crack densities in a strongly anisotropic, primarily transversely isotropic (TI) host rock. The analysis of penny-shaped cracks in the noninteraction approximation (NIA) reveals the dependence of their excess fracture compliance tensors on the orientation of the background symmetry axis. As a result of this dependence, the excess fracture compliance tensor generally becomes rotationally noninvariant even when the cracks are circular. One of the consequences of this complication (compared to the background isotropy) is a reduction of symmetry from TI to monoclinic resulting from the presence of a single oriented fracture set. Verti\\u2013cal dry cracks in a vertically transversely isotropic (VTI) host constitute an important exception to this general rule.The effective symmetry for this arrangement is approximately orthorhombic (or orthotropic) even in the presence of multiple fracture sets that have arbitrary azimuths. I perform finite-element simulations on the so-called digital rocks to verify both the proximity of effective symmetry to orthotropy and the accuracy of the NIA up to the crack density of 0.15. Multiple sets of dry vertical cracks in a VTI host not only result in nearly orthorhombic effective symmetry but also their cumulative influence is equivalent to that of just two orthogonal (or principal) fracture sets. The possibility of replacing multiple fracture sets with two orthogonal ones paves the way for their characterization. The inverse problem of estimating the parameters of two orthogonal crack systems in a VTI background from the effective elasticity, however, is known to be nonunique. I suggest overcoming its ambiguity by combining 3D, wide-azimuth, multicomponent seismic data with sonic logs.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'Although the Levenberg-Marquardt damped least-squares method is an extremely powerful tool for the iterative solution of nonlinear problems, its theoretical basis has not been described adequately in the literature. This is unfortunate, because Levenberg and Marquardt approached the solution of nonlinear problems in different ways and presented results that go far beyond the simple equation that characterizes the method. The idea of damping the solution was introduced by Levenberg, who also showed that it is possible to do that while at the same time reducing the value of a function that must be minimized iteratively. This result is not obvious, although it is taken for granted. Moreover, Levenberg derived a solution more general than the one currently used. Marquardt started with the current equation and showed that it interpolates between the ordinary least-squares-method and the steepest-descent method. In this tutorial, the two papers are combined into a unified presentation, which will help the reader gain a better understanding of what happens when solving nonlinear problems. Because the damped least-squares and steepest-descent methods are intimately related, the latter is also discussed, in particular in its relation to the gradient. When the inversion parameters have the same dimensions (and units), the direction of steepest descent is equal to the direction of minus the gradient. In other cases, it is necessary to introduce a metric (i.e., a definition of distance) in the parameter space to establish a relation between the two directions. Although neither Levenberg nor Marquardt discussed these matters, their results imply the introduction of a metric. Some of the concepts presented here are illustrated with the inversion of synthetic gravity data corresponding to a buried sphere of unknown radius and depth. Finally, the work done by early researchers that rediscovered the damped least-squares method is put into a historical context.'],\n",

The alternative exploits the difference in water depth and reservoir depth to subtract water-column noise. The proposed subtraction method works well where water depth is constant. The method was tested on a multicomponent seismic data set from the Grane field (North Sea). In this location, the water depth is fairly constant over the field. The fieldwise similarity level of water-column noise is high. A comparison of the water-column noise from various locations shows that the similarity is 10%, measured in normalized root mean squared error. The fact that the water-column noise is highly repeatable is a strong indication that the major part of it is harmonic waves that propagate in the water layer.'],\n",

The method requires surface shooting recorded at downhole receivers placed below the distorting or changing part of the overburden. Redatuming with the measured Green\\u2019s function allows the reconstruction of a complete downhole survey as if the sources were also buried at the receiver locations. There are still some challenges that need to be addressed in the virtual source method, such as limited acquisition aperture and energy coming from the overburden. We demonstrate that up-down wavefield separation can substantially improve the quality of virtual source data. First, it allows us to eliminate artifacts associated with the limited acquisition aperture typically used in practice. Second, it allows us to reconstruct a new optimized response in the absence of downgoing reflections and multiples from the overburden. These improvements are illustrated on a synthetic data set of a complex layered model modeled after the Fahud field in Oman, and on ocean-bottom seismic data acquired in the Mars field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'Near-surface wavefield perturbations can be very complex and completely mask the target reflections. Despite this complexity, conventional methods rely on parameterizations characterized by simple time and amplitude anomalies to compensate for these perturbations. Determining and compensating for time shifts is generally referred to as (residual) static corrections, whereas surface-consistent deconvolution techniques deal with amplitude anomalies. We present an approach that uses the full waveform to parameterize near-surface perturbations. Therefore, we refer to this method as waveform statics. Important differences from conventional static corrections are that this approach allows time shifts to vary with frequency and takes amplitude variations directly into account. Furthermore, the procedure is fully automated and does not rely on near-surface velocity information. The waveform static corrections are obtained usingblind channel identification and applied to the recordings using multichannel deconvolution. As a result, the method implicitly incorporates array forming. The developed method is validated on synthetic data and applied to part of a field data set acquired in an area with significant near-surface heterogeneity. The source and receiver responses obtained are strongly correlated to the near-surface conditions and show changes, both in phase and frequency content, along the spread. The application of the waveform statics demonstrates that they not only correct for near-surface wavefield perturbations, but also strongly reduce coherent noise. This results in substantial improvements, both in trace-to-trace coherency and in depth resolution. In addition, the procedure delineates reflection events that are difficult to detect prior to our proposed correction. Based on these results, we conclude that complex near-surface perturbations can be successfully dealt with using the multichannel, full-waveform, static-correction procedure.'],\n",

I present a new method to derive a 2D near-surface shear-velocity model from ambient-noise recordings made at the seafloor. The method relies on inverting horizontal- and vertical-amplitude spectra of Scholte waves propagating in the seafloor. I compare the commonly used horizontal-over-vertical spectral ratio with three alternative spectral-ratio definitions through modeling. The modeling shows that the vertical-over-total spectral ratio has some favorable properties for inversion. I describe a nonlinear inversion method for the vertical-to-total spectral ratio of the Scholte waves and apply it to an ambient-noise data set recorded by an ocean-bottom-cable (OBC) system. A 1D near-surface shear-velocity model is derived through a joint inversion of the spectral-ratio and phase-velocity data. A 2D shear-velocity model is obtained through a local inversion of the spectral ratios averaged over small groups of receivers and shows evidence for lateral heterogeneity. The newly developed method for deriving near-surface shear-velocity distribution by inverting the Scholte-wave spectral ratio measured from seabed noise provides great opportunities for estimating the shallow-seabed shear velocity in deep water. Another benefit of the method is that, with the OBC system, no additional hardware is needed; only additional recording time is required. In this case, half an hour is sufficient.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'Waves propagating across a vertical seismic profiling (VSP) array may be distinguished by their differing arrival times and linear-moveout velocities. Current methods typically assume that the waves propagate uniformly with an unvarying wavelet shape and amplitude. These assumptions break down in the presence of irregular spatial sampling, event truncations, wavelet variations, and noise. I present a new method that allows each event to independently vary in its amplitude and arrival time as it propagates across the array. The method uses an iterative global nonlinear optimization scheme that consists of several least-squares and two eigenvalue problems at each step. Events are stripped from the data one at a time. As stronger events are predicted and removed, weaker events then become visible and can be modeled in turn. As each new event is approximately modeled, the fit for all previously removed events is then revisited and updated. Iterations continue until no remaining coherent events can be distinguished. As VSP data sets are typically not large, the expense of this method is not a significant limitation. I demonstrate with a real-data example that this iterative approach can lead to a significantly better VSP wavefield separation than that which has been available when using conventional techniques.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'We present an accurate 3D ray-tracing algorithm based on a modified (more flexible and economical) shortest-path method (SPM). Unlike the regular SPM in the 3D case, which uses only primary nodes at the corners of each cell and whose accuracy depends on actual cell size, the new method can work with much larger cell sizes by introducing secondary nodes along all bounding surfaces of the cell. This increases the ray angular coverage and permits detailed specification of the velocity field. The modified SPM simultaneously calculates first-arrival times and gradually locates the related raypaths on all grid nodes as the wave field evolves. Its advantages over the regular SPM are its ability to handle high-contrast velocity models more easily, lower memory requirements and less CPU time, and the capability to calculate a relatively large 3D model without losing accuracy. The maximum relative error bound in the computed traveltimes of the modified SPM is established for a uniform velocity field, which may be considered an upper error bound for the whole model in real problems. The modified method in this study is compared with the regular SPM theoretically and on two specific velocity models. The Marmousi model is used to further test the performance of the new approach for both accuracy and flexibility in a complex velocity field. The study shows that the modified SPM is preferable to regular SPM for real 3D problems.'],\n",

The ray code of the upgoing wave is equal to the ray code of the downgoing wave in reverse order. The geometric spreading, KMAH index, and transmission and reflection coefficients of the normal-incidence ray can be expressed in terms of products or sums of the corresponding quantities of the one-way normal and normal-incidence-point (NIP) waves. Here, we show that the amplitude of the ray-theoretic Green\\u2019s function for the reflected wave also follows a similar decomposition in terms of the amplitude of the Green\\u2019s function of the NIP wave and the normal wave. We use this property to propose three schemes for true-amplitude poststack depth migration in anisotropic media where the image represents an estimate of the zero-offset reflection coefficient. The first is a map migration procedure in which selected primary zero-offset reflections are converted into depth with attached true amplitudes. The second is a ray-based, Kirchhoff-type full migration. The third is a wave equation continuation algorithm to reverse-propagate the recorded wavefield in a half-velocity model with half the elastic constants and double the density.

Propagation of quasi-P- and quasi-SV-waves in such media requires an expression of the vertical phase slowness, a complicated function of the horizontal phase slowness and the medium parameters. For converted-wave phase-shift migration methods, it is desired to have slowness expressions that are simple and accurate at wide angles of propagation. Taylor-series representations of the squared vertical slowness for quasi-P- and quasi-SV-waves result in new wide-angle phase-slowness approximations based on truncated series and continued-fraction representations. Slowness approximations that are exact for both vertical propagation and at a horizontal slowness corresponding to horizontally traveling qP-waves are derived. The approximation for quasi-SV-waves can be used in phase-shift migration in media where the quasi-SV wavefront contains triplications. These approximations are tested on several models and compared to previously published approximations. The numerical tests suggest that the new continued-fraction approximations are more accurate.

       " {u'abstract': [u'Tomographic imaging problems are typically ill-posed and often require the use of regularization techniques to guarantee a stable solution. Minimization of a weighted norm of model length is one commonly used secondary constraint. Tikhonov methods exploit low-order differential operators to select for solutions that are small, flat, or smooth in one or more dimensions. This class of regularizing functionals may not always be appropriate, particularly in cases where the anomaly being imaged is generated by a nonsmooth spatial process. Time-lapse imaging of flow-induced velocity anomalies is one such case; flow features are often characterized by spatial compactness or connectivity. By performing inversions on differenced arrival time data, the properties of the time-lapse feature can be directly constrained. We develop a differential traveltime tomography algorithm whichselects for compact solutions, i.e., models with a minimum area of support, through application of model-space iteratively reweighted least squares. Our technique is an adaptation of minimum support regularization methods previously explored within the potential theory community. We compare our inversion algorithm to the results obtained by traditional Tikhonov regularization for two simple synthetic models: one including several sharp localized anomalies and a second with smoother features.

Such processes include erosion, sediment transport, and deposition. The resulting forward model is typically nonlinear. Given observations and a misfit measure, one may attempt inversion of these models to estimate process parameters that yield compatible predictions. For seismostratigraphic inversion, seismic data are used as observations. We tested such an algorithm in a prograding-delta environment to examine the effect of using different seismic attributes as observations and, thus, different choices of misfit measures. The first measure,based on the degree of parallelism between seismic reflectors and modeled geologic strata, demonstrated a trade-off between geologic time and the sediment-influx rate used to parameterize the model. A second misfit measure used unwrapped seismic instantaneous phase as a crude proxy to relative geologic time, which regularized the model parameters. Then last, we combined the two measures to take advantage of their individual characteristics. For most of these inversion experiments, we obtained results that capture the geometry of the geologic strata as observed on the seismic data. With the exception of the depositional time-rate trade-off, where the same strata can be obtained in a shorter geologic interval when rates are increased, we found the inversion to be surprisingly stable, with a unique cluster of acceptable parameters, despite the nonlinearity of the geologic forward model.'],\n",

A robust, selective directional continuity test is achieved by combining measures of coherence computed from a few aligned, steered windows. Finally, fault detection consists of finding the maximum directional response and accumulating it into an attribute volume.

This effect is known as mesoscopic loss, because it is a consequence of fluid flow at mesoscopic-scale inhomogeneities. These are larger than the pore size but smaller than the wavelength, typically tens of centimeters, and are due to local variations in lithological properties or to patches of immiscible fluids. Basically, a P-wave traveling in a porous medium induces a fluid-pressure gradient in regions of different properties, such as patches saturated with different fluids, generating slow P-waves, which diffuse away from the interfaces separating the fluids. This mechanism can be explained by the combined effect of mesoscopic-scale inhomogeneities and mode conversion at interfaces. We consider a periodically stratified medium and perform numerical experiments to determine the P-wave quality factor in partially saturated rocks. The modeling method is an iterative domain-decomposition 2D finite-element algorithm for solving Biot equations of motion in a parallel computer, which is a requirement to run the numerical experiments at seismic frequencies. The simulated pulses show evidence of the mesoscopic-loss mechanism, and the quality factors estimated with the spectral-ratio and frequency-shift methods are in good agreement with the theoretical values predicted by the White theory.

       " {u'abstract': [u'The knowledge of moisture-content changes in shallow soil layers has important environmental implications, and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) used in surface-to-surface configuration has been used increasingly to quickly image soil moisture content over large areas. The technique is based on measuring direct GPR wave velocity in the ground. However, in the presence of shallow and thin low-velocity soil layers, dispersive guided GPR waves are generated and the direct ground wave is not identifiable as a simple arrival. Under such conditions, the dispersion relation of guided waves can be estimated from field data and then inverted to obtain the properties of the guiding layers. This approach is applied to a mountain slope with a 1-m soil cover where repeated measurements over time, inverted by conceptualizing the soil as a single guiding layer, lead to estimates of velocity andthickness varying over time. Varying soil thickness clearly is not a plausible physical process. To remove this problem, we develop a multilayer GPR waveguide model. We first assess, using a Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis, the model error arising from using a single-layer forward model to invert data generated by a multilayer waveguide. The single-layer model always underestimates the total soil thickness because the inversion is sensitive mainly to the layer with the lowest velocity (the wettest layer). We then use a multilayer forward model to invert the actual field data. By constraining the total soil thickness, we still manage to invert accurately only for velocity and thickness of the wettest layer, leaving uncertainty about the position of such a layer in the layer sequence. We conclude that these inversion equivalence problems cannot be neglected when guided GPR data are used to estimate time-lapse moisture content in shallow soils.'],\n",

The minimization of the first-order entropy favors solutions presenting sharp borders, and the maximization of the zeroth-order entropy prevents the tendency of the source estimate to become a single prism.

We present a practical method, based on model studies, to derive an optimum upward continuation height for regional-residual gravity separation. Using this method we can calculate an optimal height for upward continuation. Although mathematically there is no optimum height, this method provides an objective procedure to calculate a best height for upward continuation. We initially use a 2D model to calculate an optimum separation height, as given by the maximum crosscorrelation between the upward continuation of the observed gravity and a known regional anomaly. For an unknown regional field, we calculate a series of crosscorrelations between the upward continuations at two successive heights. The average height of the maximum deflection of these crosscorrelation values yields the optimum height for regional-residual separation. The method was applied to the Bouguer gravity anomaly over a mineral deposit in the Jilin province in northeast China. When we subtract the estimated regional anomaly obtained in this manner from the Bouguer anomaly, we can obtain a residual anomaly that clearly shows the location of two known iron bodies.'],\n",

Consequently, the model solutions are strongly dependent on the starting model and are easily trapped in local minima. Simulated annealing (SA) starts from the Boltzmann distribution and runs both downhill and uphill searches, rendering the searching process to easily jump out of local minima and converge to a global minimum. In the SA process, the calculation of Jacobian derivatives can be avoided because no preferred searching direction is required as in the case of the traditional algorithms. We apply SA technology for airborne EM inversion by comparing the inversion with a thermodynamic process, and we discuss specifically the SA procedure with respect to model configuration, random walk for model updates, objective function, and annealing schedule. We demonstrate the SA flexibility for starting models by allowing the model parameters to vary in a large range (far away from the true model). Further, we choose a temperature-dependent random walk for model updates and an exponential cooling schedule for the SA searching process. The initial temperature for the SA cooling scheme is chosen differently for different model parameters according to their resolvabilities. We examine the effectiveness of the algorithm for airborne EM by inverting both theoretical and survey data and by comparing the results with those from the traditional algorithms.'],\n",

Analysis of the symmetries of the modeled anisotropic response shows that the medium is mostly a horizontal transverse isotropic medium, with small azimuthal variation of the symmetry axis. Analysis of each independent fracture type shows that the anisotropy is mainly driven by open or partially healed fractures, but also consistent with stress-related, drilling-induced fractures. Therefore, the measured sonic anisotropy is caused by the combination of stress and fracture effects where the predominance of one mechanism over the other is depth-dependent.

In this study, we use a laboratory model made of an orthorhombic Phenolite block to study acoustic logging in deviated wells. We first measure the qP-, qSV-, and SH-wave group velocities by using body waves at angles of 0\\xb0, 15\\xb0, 30\\xb0, 45\\xb0, 60\\xb0, 75\\xb0, and 90\\xb0 relative to the slowest P-wave principal axis of the Phenolite block.

We record monopole and dipole sonic waveforms in these holes and extract the qP-, qSV-, SH-, and Stoneley-wave velocities by using the slowness-time semblance method. The velocities measured through the use of monopole logging and dipole logging vary with borehole deviations. We find that an equivalent transversely isotropic (TI) model can fit the measured qP-, qSV-, and Stoneley-wave velocities very well.

One source of this problem is poor detector coupling with the seabed that produces resonances and phase distortions. Coupling and data quality are generally excellent for the inline component. However, the crossline component often exhibits low-frequency resonance compared to the inline. Also, OBCs are susceptible to rotational modes about the cable axis that produce spurious S-waves on the vertical component. I derive a method for correcting the crossline and vertical components based on a model of OBC detector coupling, and design vector operators in the frequency domain from shots over many offsets and azimuths. The crossline data are corrected,relative to the inline, assuming linear polarization of early, near-offset arrivals on the radial-horizontal component. Thus, the transverse-horizontal component provides a convenient error or objective function to be minimized for operator design. Using the corrected crossline, as a model of rotational modes, leads to an estimate of spurious S-waves on the vertical component, which are adaptively subtracted. Data examples from the Gulf of Mexico and offshore Nigeria are presented to illustrate improvements in crossline frequency content and match to inline data. Typically there is  ',\n",

We introduce another monotonically increasing and asymptotically bounded model, which approaches the asymptotic value in a slower and smoother fashion. Its main attractiveness is the simplicity of ray tracing. The ray trajectories in this model are elliptic, hyperbolic, or parabolic curves, depending on the ray parameter (horizontal slowness). The linear velocity model with a circular trajectory is a particular case of the proposed model. Because the shapes of the ray trajectories correspond to the three types of conic sections, we call the model Conic.

       " {u'abstract': [u'Amplitudes in shot-profile migration can be improved if the imaging condition incorporates a division (deconvolution in the time domain) of the upgoing wavefield by the downgoing wavefield. This division can be enhanced by introducing an optimal Wiener filter which assumes that the noise present in the data has a white spectrum. This assumption requires a damping parameter, related to the signal-to-noise ratio, often chosen by trial and error. In practice, the damping parameter replaces the small values of the spectrum of the downgoing wavefield and avoids division by zero. The migration results can be quite sensitive to the damping parameter, and in most applications, the upgoing and downgoing wavefields are simply multiplied. Alternatively, the division can be made stable by filling the small values of thespectrum with an average of the neighboring points. This averaging is obtained by running a smoothing operator on the spectrum of the downgoing wavefield. This operation called the smoothing imaging condition. Our results show that where the spectrum of the downgoing wavefield is high, the imaging condition with damping and smoothing yields similar results, thus correcting for illumination effects. Where the spectrum is low, the smoothing imaging condition tends to be more robust to the noise level present in the data, thus giving better images than the imaging condition with damping. In addition, our experiments indicate that the parameterization of the smoothing imaging condition, i.e., choice of window size for the smoothing operator, is easy and repeatable from one data set to another, making it a valuable addition to our imaging toolbox.'],\n",

It overcomes the limitations of Kirchhoff migration in imaging multipathing arrivals, while retaining its efficiency and its capability of imaging steep dips with turning waves. Extension of this migration method to anisotropic media has, however, been hampered by the difficulties in traditional kinematic and dynamic ray-tracing systems in inhomogeneous, anisotropic media. Formulated in terms of elastic parameters, the traditional anisotropic ray-tracing systems aredifficult to implement and inefficient for computation, especially for the dynamic ray-tracing system. They may also result inambiguity in specifying elastic parameters for a given medium.To overcome these difficulties, we have reformulated the ray-tracing systems in terms of phase velocity.These reformulated systems are simple and especially useful for general transversely isotropic and weak orthorhombic media, because the phase velocities for these two types of media can be computed with simple analytic expressions. These two types of media also represent the majority of anisotropy observed in sedimentary rocks. Based on these newly developed ray-tracing systems, we have extended prestack Gaussian-beam depth migration to general transversely isotropic media.

       " {u'abstract': [u'We present a three-step magnetic inversion procedure in which invariant quantities with respect to source parameters are inverted sequentially to give (1) shape cross section, (2) magnetization intensity, and (3) magnetization direction for a 2D (elongated) magnetic source. The quantity first inverted (called here the shape function) is obtained from the ratio of the gradient intensity of the total-field anomaly to the intensity of the anomalous vector field. For homogenous sources, the shape function is invariant with source magnetization and allows reconstruction of the source geometry by attributing an arbitrary magnetization to trial solutions. Once determined, the source shape is fixed and magnetization intensity is estimated by fitting the total gradient of the total-field anomaly (equivalent to the amplitude of the analytic signal of magnetic anomaly). Finally, the source shape and magnetization intensity are fixed and the magnetization direction is determined by fitting the magnetic anomaly. As suggested by numerical modeling and real data application, stepped inversion allows checking whether causative sources are homogeneous. This is possible because the shape function from inhomogeneous sources can be fitted by homogeneous models, but a model obtained in this way fits neither the total gradient of the magnetic anomaly nor the magnetic anomaly itself. Such a criterion seems effective in recognizing strongly inhomogeneous sources.

Recent research has shown that frequency-domain helicopter electromagnetic data collected over a conductive half-space such as calm seawater can be used to correct system calibration errors. However, most historic surveys consist only of data collected over land, where the conductive half-space assumption is rarely justified. We estimate the required recalibration parameters by analyzing systematic misfits in the inversion of statistically chosen measures of historic data. Our method requires the identification, within the survey area, of a zone of conductive responses that are reasonably uniform. From this zone, a set of altitude-corrected median responses are estimated. These are inverted using geologically specifiedconstraints to obtain a best-fit layered earth model. Systematic inconsistencies between the median measured altitude and the inverted depth to surface are attributed to altitude error. Remaining frequency-dependent fitting errors are assumed to be the calibration errors. We tested the method with partial success on helicopter electromagnetic data sets collected over uniform deep sediments where seawater data were also available and two different inland surveys over multiple lithologies in one general area. At high frequencies, our method works reliably. Recalibration of low-frequency data is not possible if the area used as a reference consists of moderate or poor conductors. In this case, data amplitudes are small and are greatly affected by imperfect drift and magnetic susceptibility corrections.

       " {u'abstract': [u\"Effective medium theories (EMTs) are invoked routinely to interpret multifrequency dispersions of dielectric permittivity and electrical conductivity of saturated rocks. However, EMTs exhibit limitations that substantially restrict their validity for petrophysical interpretation. For instance, pore connectivity is of significant interest in the study of subsurface reservoirs, but no existing EMT includes it as an explicit property in the analysis of kilohertz- to gigahertz-range dielectric measurements. We introduce a new approach to quantify the effects of pore geometry and connectivity on the kilohertz-gigahertz frequency dispersion of dielectric permittivity and electrical conductivity of clay-free porous rocks. This approach is based on the numerical solution of the internal electric fields within submicron-resolution pore maps constructed with grain and rock pixels. The discrepancy between the internal fields and electrical currents calculated for ahomogeneous scatterer and those calculated for a given pore map is minimized to yield the effective electrical conductivity and dielectric constant for that pore map. This minimization is performed independently for each frequency and is verified to agree implicitly with Kramers-Kronig's causality relationships. We show that EMTs only predict an average dispersion for given microscopic geometrical parameters (e.g., porosity, pore eccentricity), whereas individual realizations honoring the same parameters are associated with dispersion about average values predicted by EMTs. Unlike any EMT prediction, we show that pore connectivity plays a major role in both the shape and amplitude of wide-band electromagnetic property dispersions. The simulation procedure introduced in this paper provides a systematic method to assess the sensitivity of a multitude of pore-scale properties on the macroscopic wide-band dielectric dispersion of saturated rocks.\"],\n",

We have constructed an optimized, model-based linear AVO equation that is more accurate than usual AVO approximations. The parameters of this equation represent new AVO attributes that are more directly related to the information contained in seismic reflection amplitudes. We use these new AVO attributes to classify reflector responses from field data. Five seismic facies are defined that are characterized by differentdistributions of seismic parameters. Nine reflector classes are formed by associating appropriate pairs of facies. The expected locations of the different reflector classes in the space of optimized attributes are found by modeling and are used to derive a classification scheme. This scheme is applied to sections of optimized attributes calculated from the prestack data, leading to a vertical section showing the distribution of most probable facies in an area containing a sand reservoir. We compare the new approach to classification with intercept and gradient. The new method is more robust and less sensitive to the number of attributes (two or three) used for classification.

       " {u'abstract': [u'Linear equations used to approximate reflection coefficient-versus-angle curves are usually valid only for small seismic parameter changes across reflectors, and they are rather inaccurate close to the critical angle. These inaccuracies affect the quality of AVO analysis and cause systematic errors when estimating relative seismic-parameter variations at reflectors, especially for density. We present an optimal model-based approach to build more accurate linear AVO approximations. Their basis functions are calculated by applying singular value decomposition to realistic modeled AVO curves. By extending the validity range of linear approximations to larger angles, this approach helps when using information contained at near-critical offsets. It alsooffers several advantages in other situations. The basis functions of the new approximations are orthogonal. Their coefficients represent new AVO attributes that can be used either to classify AVO responses directly, or to obtain more accurate estimates of usual AVO attributes (intercept, gradient, and possibly a third coefficient). This leads to a better estimation of seismic-parameter contrasts at reflecting interfaces. These coefficients are naturally sorted in decreasing order of importance. Therefore, the proper number of terms in the proposed equations can be chosen easily to offer an optimal compromise between noise and the information carried by each coefficient. Synthetic tests confirm the robustness of the method. This flexible and robust approach will be particularly well adapted for three-parameter AVO analysis.'],\n",

       " {u'abstract': [u'Amchitka Island, in Alaska, was used for underground nuclear testing from 1965 to 1971. Since the test program concluded, there have been concerns about the possible release of radionuclides into the marine environment of the Aleutian Islands. The hydrogeology of islands such as Amchitka is characterized by a layer of freshwater overlying a saltwater layer, with the salinity increasing across a transition zone (TZ). Hydrogeologic modeling can provide an estimate of the timing and amount of radionuclide release from the explosions beneath Amchitka Island. This modeling is inconclusive because of a lack of information regarding subsurface structure. To address this problem, magnetotelluric (MT) data were collected on Amchitka Island in 2004. Broadband MT data were recorded on profiles passing through three explosion sites to give information about subsurface porosity and salinity. A 2D MT inversion produced models of sub-surface electrical resistivity and showed a pattern of increasing, decreasing, and increasing resistivity with depth at each test site. The depth at which resistivity begins to decrease defines the top of the TZ. The deeper increase in resistivity approximates the base of the TZ. The depths of the top and bottom of the TZ were determined as follows: Cannikin 900\\u20132500 m; Long Shot 600\\u20131700 m; Milrow 900\\u20131700 m. Uncertainties were estimated for these depths. Effective porosities were also estimated and ranged from 10%\\u201320% at the surface to 1%\\u20133% at 3-km depth. These porosities are higher than those assumed in several hydrogeologic models, and give longer transit times from the explosion to the marine environment. Subject to the limits of the analysis, it appears that each of the cavities resulting from underground nuclear explosions is located in the TZ from fresh to saltwater. This implies shorter transit times to the marine environment than if the detonations had been located in the saltwater layer.'],\n",

However, the same geological processes that create the possible hydrocarbon reservoir may also create topography and near-surface variations of resistivity (e.g., shallow gas or hydrates) that can complicate the interpretation of CSEM data. In this paper, we discuss the interpretation of such data over a thrust belt prospect in deepwater Sabah, Malaysia. We show that detailed modeling of the key scenarios can help us understand the contributions of topography, near-surface hydrates, and possible hydrocarbons at reservoir depth.

We consider the porosity and fluid saturation of each layer in the reservoir, the bulk and shear moduli and density of each layer not in the reservoir, and the electrical conductivity of the overburden and bedrock as random variables. We also consider prestack seismic AVA data in a selected time window as well as real and quadrature components of the recorded electrical field as data. Using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods, wedraw a large number of samples from the joint posterior distribution function. With these samples, we obtain not only the estimates of each unknown variable, but also various types of uncertainty information associated with the estimation. This method is applied to both synthetic and field data to investigate the combined use of seismic AVA and CSEM data for gas saturation estimation. Results show that the method is effective for joint inversion; the incorporation of CSEM data reduces uncertainty in fluid saturation estimation compared to inversion of seismic AVA data alone. The improvement in gas saturation estimation obtained from joint inversion for field data is less significant than for synthetic data because of the large number of unknown noise sources inherent in the field data.'],\n",

We develop a new form of the quasi-analytical approximation for models with variable background conductivity (QAVB) and apply this form for more efficient Fr\\xe9chet derivative calculations. This approach requires just one forward modeling on every iteration of the regularized gradient-type inversion algorithm, which speeds up the computations significantly. We also use a regularized focusing inversion method, which provides a sharp boundary image of the petroleum reservoir.

       " {u'abstract': [u'Early development of marine electromagnetic methods, dating back about 80 years, was driven largely by defense/military applications, and use for these purposes continues to this day. Deepwater, frequency-domain, electric dipole-dipole, controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) methods arose from academic studies of the oceanic lithosphere in the 1980s, and although the hydrocarbon exploration industry was aware of this work, the shallow-water environments being explored at that time were not ideally suited for its use. Low oil prices and increasingly successful results from 3D seismic methods further discouraged investment in costly alternative geophysical data streams. These circumstances changed in the late 1990s, when both Statoil and ExxonMobil began modeling studies and fieldtrials of CSEM surveying in deep water (around  ',\n",

Trials offshore Angola in 2000\\u20132002 by both these companies showed that CSEM data can successfully be used to evaluate reservoir resistivity for targets as deep as several thousand meters. Both companies leveraged instrumentation and expertise from the academic community to make swift progress. The resulting rapid growth in the use of marine EM methods for exploration has created a demand for trained personnel that is difficult to meet; nevertheless, at this time, CSEM data represent a commercial commodity within the exploration business, and acquisition services are offered by three companies. The ability to determine the resistivity of deep drilling targets from the seafloor may well make marine CSEM the most important geophysical technique to emerge since 3D reflection seismology.'],\n",
